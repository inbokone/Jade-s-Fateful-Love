19

What suddenly made you

20
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,900
ask me out for some shopping?

21
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,980
I promised to take you for some shopping,

22
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,140
but I didn't have time.

23
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,660
Today, I'm available

24
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,700
and I can take you out for a walk.

25
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,940
The Beishuo court had too many coups.

26
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:06,180
Weak emperor, powerful ministers,
and numerous lords.

27
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,620
The Prime Minister takes charge of everything.

28
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,460
The two princes can do nothing.

29
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,180
One is an idiot and the other is a coward.

30
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,340
Kids,

31
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,540
you just said "One is an idiot
and the other is a coward."

32
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,220
Everybody in the Capital City knows this.

33
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,500
The South Prince claims to be smart,

34
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,940
but turns out to be an idiot.

35
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,140
We also know

36
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,260
the North Prince claims to be courageous,

37
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,740
but turns out to be a coward.

38
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,220
It's such a clever rhyme.

39
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,500
Can you sing it again for me?

40
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,140
The Beishuo court had too many coups.

41
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:48,180
Weak emperor, powerful ministers,
and numerous lords.

42
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,260
The Prime Minister takes charge of everything.

43
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,140
The two princes can do nothing.

44
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,420
One is an idiot and the other is a coward.

45
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,970
Let's go.

46
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,860
Wait a minute.

47
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,700
Go.

48
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,660
This rhyme is wrong.

49
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,980
What is wrong?

50
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,220
It should be "The two princes are different.

51
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,940
One is silly and the other is great."

52
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,490
- We're used to this rhyme.
- We're used to this rhyme.

53
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,180
We're not going to change it.
We're not going to change it.

54
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,660
Yeah. We're not going to change it.

55
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,540
Sugarcoated haws.

56
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,380
Wait.

57
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,660
Can you change it now?

58
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,380
- Yes.
- Yes.

59
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,220
Here.

60
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,380
Take it.

61
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,260
Now do you know what to chant?

62
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,380
- Yes, we do.
- Yes.

63
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,220
- Let's go.
- Sugarcoated haws.

64
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,940
The Beishuo court had too many coups.

65
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,420
Weak emperor, powerful ministers,
and numerous lords.

00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,540
The Prime Minister takes charge of everything.

67
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,500
The two princes are different.

68
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,420
One is silly and the other is great.

69
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,540
It's not a rhyme for you.

70
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,020
Are you really this happy?

71
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:07,860
Yes.

72
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,780
You're quite loyal to the North Prince.

73
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,820
For me?

74
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,860
Actually, the North Prince...

75
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,500
Someone is selling sugar figures there.

76
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,420
Sugar figures for sale.

77
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,060
Fresh sugar figures.

78
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,780
Sir,

79
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:28,980
one sugar figure, please.

80
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:29,850
All right.

81
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,780
Can I have more?

82
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,820
Xingyi, Qianqian,

83
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,820
Rubing, Rushuang,

84
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,860
Daqi, and Dali.

85
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,140
There are many of us.

86
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,700
Pack all these for me.

87
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,220
All right.

88
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,660
Please send them to the North Prince's Mansion.

89
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,500
You're from there?

90
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,100
Umm...

91
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,740
The North Prince is a great man.

92
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,460
He once helped me.

93
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,940
I can't charge any money

94
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,240
from anyone working for His Highness.

95
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,940
I'll deliver

96
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,220
all these sugar figures.

97
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,380
Don't stand on ceremony.

98
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,420
Come whenever you want it.

99
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,660
Sir, are you sure?

100
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,220
It is the North Prince.

101
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,380
Exactly.

102
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,100
It's the North Prince, Miss.

103
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,260
His Highness saved my life.

104
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,460
My village was hit hard by the plague.

105
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,700
The North Prince had some medicine sent to us.

106
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,900
Otherwise, my mother and I

107
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,140
would have died that winter.

108
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,700
I told you.

109
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,660
The North Prince is different

110
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,700
from what people think he is.

111
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,100
Some praise him

112
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,660
while some criticize him.

113
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,180
Who should I trust?

114
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,820
Just remember. The South Prince is an idiot

115
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,380
while the North Prince isn't.

116
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,860
Who?

117
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,580
Who's cursing me?

118
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,140
What is this, lotus or chrysanthemum?

119
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,420
Your Highness, don't scold me.

120
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,260
Please don't scold me.

121
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,460
I have to scold you!

122
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,940
Your Highness, I was...

123
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,140
Was enchanted, huh?

124
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,220
I asked you to appreciate my painting.

125
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,060
Why did no one of you say anything?

126
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,540
I know.

127
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,380
You're too thrilled to praise me.

128
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,180
But you can use

129
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,860
those pale and cheesy compliments.

130
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,540
Come on, Chunhua.

131
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,500
You go first.

132
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,420
Your Highness, look at your first painting.

133
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,140
This is really vivid,

134
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,180
wonderful,

135
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,780
and impressive.

136
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,700
In my life,

137
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,020
I've never seen such a fancy...

138
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,580
Lotus.

139
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,420
What lotus? Such poor eyesight!

140
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,020
It's a chrysanthemum!

141
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,860
You have no aesthetic sense at all.

142
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,900
Next, next.

143
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:30,500
Your Highness, let me wildly guess.

144
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,860
Your Highness, you tried to paint

145
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,380
the shrimp very big.

146
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,180
Through your painting,

147
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,580
this shrimp looks so crystal,

148
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,860
vivid,

149
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,100
and rather...

150
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,500
Pleasant.

151
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,980
- Go on.
- Your Highness.

152
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,860
- I...
- Your Highness.

153
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,220
The North Prince has come out
with the Princess of Dongyu.

154
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,540
Now, they're having fun on the street.

155
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,740
What?

156
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,620
The princess has come out again.

157
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,140
What, Your Highness?

158
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:10,980
Aren't we going out?

159
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,740
Is the North Prince also there?

160
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,580
Yes.

161
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,380
Then I have to dress up

162
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,820
and surpass him.

163
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,340
I'll show the princess

164
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,820
that I'm the most handsome man in Beishuo!

165
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,540
- Right.
- Your Highness, are you sure?

166
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,740
Yes. Why not?

167
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,620
I won't bother to talk to you.

168
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,660
Later, the four of you will help me dress.

169
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:36,900
After that,

170
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,260
I'll go out and test how popular I can be.

171
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,380
Let's go.

172
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,540
- Yes.
- Yes.

173
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,740
Oh, Your Highness.

174
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,100
Look. That one looks so pretty.

175
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,940
My sister and I

176
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,220
traveled throughout Dongyu,

177
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,540
enjoying the life and food

178
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,340
in different places.

179
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,540
We also ran after the sheep on the grassland.

180
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,860
It was such an expanse

181
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,100
and life was great.

182
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,180
This kind of life is so free and wonderful.

183
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,860
Hearing this,

184
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,860
I quite yearn for that life.

185
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,900
It's no big deal.

186
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,740
You're my friend now.

187
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,660
Your business will be mine.

188
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:19,980
When possible,

189
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,020
I'll take you back to Dongyu

190
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,100
and ride a horse on the grassland.

191
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,620
That kind of life will be really great.

192
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,420
Thank you, then.

193
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,260
Will you keep your word?

194
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,460
Yes, of course.

195
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,140
I'm a prince of my word.

196
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,860
Prince?

197
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,060
Then your sister...

198
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,180
She's a princess, of course.

199
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,900
Since you're my friend,

200
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,420
I won't keep secrets from you.

201
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,060
Rest assured.

202
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,060
I'll take you back to Dongyu

203
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,780
and ride a horse.

204
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,420
But Her Grace will marry the North Prince.

205
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,740
I don't think she can return to Dongyu.

206
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,100
That's not true.

207
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,660
We'll leave someday.

208
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,340
Leave?

209
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,660
It's hard, I guess.

210
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,660
Why?

211
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,620
I heard

212
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,100
the North Prince was a loser.

213
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,900
And we have something on him.

214
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,140
It'll be easy.

215
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,500
Something on him?

216
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,860
I hear the North Prince isn't that useless.

217
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,660
I don't think you can
easily have something on him.

218
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,460
We have the account...

219
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,780
Anyway, we have something serious.

220
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,940
If you leave here,

221
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,260
you won't be back again, huh?

222
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,420
We won't, of course.

223
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,820
Why would we come back again?

224
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,220
And nothing

225
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,900
can keep me here in Beishuo.

226
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,620
Too bad.

227
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,220
I can't leave here.

228
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,500
Otherwise,

229
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,700
I really wish to see your grassland

230
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,740
and taste the food there.

231
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,780
You want to taste our food?

232
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,860
That's easy.

233
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,260
Someday,

234
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,740
I'll take you to where I live.

235
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,860
We have chefs.

236
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,300
They cook perfectly.

237
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,660
Well, thank you, Your Highness.

238
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,860
You're welcome.

239
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,300
Let's drink.

240
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,060
Stop coming over.

241
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,100
Move. Move.

242
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,780
Make way.

243
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,220
Stop looking. Leave.

244
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,660
Don't come this way.

245
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,140
Xu.

246
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,170
Yes, Your Highness.

247
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,500
Is everybody looking at me?

248
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,260
- Stop looking. Stop.
- Yes, Your Highness.

249
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,180
Their eyes are all drawn

250
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,060
to you.

251
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,540
They must have been conquered
by your handsome appearance.

252
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,140
Stop looking. Stop.

253
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,380
Hey, you. Stop looking.

254
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,240
Don't come this way.

255
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,260
Move away.

256
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,700
What are you doing?

257
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,020
You stop me every time I walk up.

258
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,460
What exactly do you want?

259
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,100
I've been watching you for two hours.

260
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,860
Is there nothing else you can do?

261
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,460
Nothing serious, huh?

262
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,180
You stay here and play cool.

263
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,700
What's wrong with you guys?

264
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,820
You don't look handsome, anyway.

265
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,500
You're even stinging my eyes.

266
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,180
I'm walking, but you keep stopping me.

267
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,220
What do you want?

268
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,620
Can't we even walk by?

269
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,940
What? You own this street?

270
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,140
You stop people from passing by.

271
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,780
What's wrong with you?

272
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,260
Your Highness, how about we leave?

273
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,900
My heart is broken.

274
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,060
What is your problem?

275
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,900
Will you stop me again?

276
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,100
You always make trouble.

277
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,940
Just leave here.

278
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:26,940
Look at you.

279
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,340
What makes you think you're handsome?

280
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,460
- Why do you stare at me?
- Let's go.

281
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,700
Do something serious, will you?

282
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,660
She's scary.

283
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,500
All you can do is play cool.

284
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,660
What's the point of that?

285
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,620
How does it taste?

286
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,860
What pastry is this?

287
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,900
Tastes great.

288
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,340
Pear blossom cake.

289
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,380
Pear blossom cake?

290
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,260
It's good.

291
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,100
Looks like all the pastries in Beishuo

292
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,300
tastes good.

293
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,660
If you like it,

294
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,740
I'll buy you more.

295
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,060
Wen Yu, it's so nice of you.

296
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,140
If anyone marries you,

297
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,780
she'll live a great life.

298
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,340
Actually, I have something to...

299
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,220
- Why is it you?
- Why is it you?

300
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,700
Oh, you spoke in unison.

301
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,220
Why can't it be me?

302
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,220
You took the princess out

303
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,460
and this is what you fed her?

304
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,220
Such cheap food.

305
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,060
Xu.

306
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,010
Yes, Your Highness.

307
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,060
Ask the shopkeeper
to bring us all the best food.

308
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,340
Today, I'll taste the civilian food, too.

309
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,780
Yes, Your Highness.

310
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,180
Idiot prin...

311
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,100
Your Highness,

312
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,540
what brings you here?

313
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,420
Don't bother to talk to a peacock.

314
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,540
Come on. Let's go float the lanterns.

315
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,700
Peacock, really?

316
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,060
How dare you talk to him like this?

317
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:57,900
Let's go.

318
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,020
Who's the peacock?

319
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,500
Zhou Shiyu!

320
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,700
Hurry, sir.

321
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,980
Bring us the best dishes

322
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,980
you can offer!

323
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,180
Where is His Highness?

324
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,700
Your Highness?

325
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,180
Your Highness!

326
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,340
(Hope I can return to Dongyu soon.)

327
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,380
Such a big fish lantern.

328
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,260
Yeah.

329
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,580
Let's go, Your Highness.

330
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,380
Floating the lanterns, huh?

331
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,660
Hey. Don't go.

332
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,220
What do you think of my lantern?

333
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,220
It's too big.

334
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:56,940
Everything else is fine.

335
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,820
Hey, I...

336
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,940
Your Highness, umm...

337
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,360
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

338
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,490
- Nice!
- Nice!

339
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,140
It's getting late.

340
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,940
We should go back early.

341
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,900
I have something to tell...

342
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,940
So bustling.

343
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,540
Look over there.

344
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,060
- Bravo!
- Nice!

345
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,100
I'll go check over there

346
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,700
and buy some pastry for my men.

347
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,540
All right.

348
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,940
I have something to tell...

349
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,220
The two of you, stop!

350
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,740
You aren't married yet.

351
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,860
This is so indecent.

352
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,860
Married?

353
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,860
Who is supposed to be married?

354
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,300
The two of you.

355
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,940
You shop, eat,

356
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,180
and watch the lanterns together.

357
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,460
Why did you bother to ask?

358
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,220
The two of us?

359
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,380
Do you get it wrong?

360
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,780
He is Wen Yu.

361
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,180
Wen Yu?

362
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,140
Who is Wen Yu?

363
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:47,940
You?

364
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,380
Why do I not know

365
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,540
you have this name?

366
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,220
There's a lot of things you don't know.

367
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,590
What's that supposed to mean?

368
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,780
Is this...?

369
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,940
Is this a trick of a new couple?

370
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,380
North Prince, explain this!

371
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,060
North Prince?

372
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,300
I'm more confused.

373
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,260
Let's go.

374
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,680
Move, move.

375
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,180
Don't be scared.

376
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,980
It's you again, huh?

377
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,620
What an idiot you are!

378
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,580
I'm still here. Are you trying to kill me?

379
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,780
I didn't arrange this, Your Highness.

380
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,660
I also don't know who they are.

381
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,220
So, they're real assassins.

382
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,700
Protect His Highness!

383
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:45,860
Fall back!

384
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,900
Greetings, Your Highness.

385
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,980
We came too late.

386
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,300
Please punish us, Your Highness.

387
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,660
Your Highness?

388
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,140
How daring!

389
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,700
Can't you see I'm also here?

390
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,140
Why did you only talk to the North Prince?

391
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,500
Are you or are you not the North Prince?

392
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,900
- I am.
- What about Wen Yu?

393
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,820
That's also me. But...

394
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,380
So, you were lying to me!

395
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,260
Yueling.

396
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,420
Yueling, let me explain.

397
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,200
I really didn't expect...

398
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,980
- You're the royal prince.
- Things would end up like this.

399
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,080
You don't need to explain anything.

400
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:45,740
Yueling.

401
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,220
They had a quarrel.

402
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,260
It's really something new.

403
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,260
Your Highness, it's a good time.

404
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,100
Let's go.

405
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,980
Your Grace, be my girl.

406
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,480
I'm certainly more thoughtful than Zhou Shiyu.

407
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,980
I'm at least more handsome, huh?

408
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,220
Get out of my way.

409
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,020
You'd better go back home immediately.

410
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,260
Zhou Shiyu, I'm your second brother!

411
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,260
How can you be so rude to me?

412
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,300
I'll complain to Brother.

413
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,980
Someone will assassinate you
in the South Street.

414
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,020
If you want to live, go to the garrison now.

415
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,900
(How does he know again?)

416
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,540
Don't try to fool me.

417
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,100
In the Capital City, who dares to kill me?

418
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,460
Zhou Shiyu is so evil.

419
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,700
What's wrong, Your Highness?

420
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,420
Yang Xu.

421
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,820
I'm here.

422
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,820
Why do I feel I was killed just now?

423
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,460
Killed?

424
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,500
Get some guards to protect me. Hurry.

425
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,380
Your Highness, how can you
trust the North Prince?

426
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,700
Idiot.

427
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,580
You have no idea. Just go get the guards.

428
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,460
Yes.

429
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:57,180
I'm on it.

430
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,900
Yueling.

431
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,220
Yueling.

432
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,300
Yueling, let's talk.

433
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,220
You're the North Prince.

434
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,460
What do you have to talk about with me?

435
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,060
I didn't mean to keep it from you.

436
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,340
But I didn't know how to tell you about it.

437
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,980
Today, I asked you out

438
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,620
just to tell you who I was.

439
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,540
It's been such a long time.

440
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,980
You concealed your identity quite perfectly.

441
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,580
What did you say?

442
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,500
"One is silly and the other is great."

443
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,540
You helped the kids to modify the rhyme.

444
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,900
I thought you were loyal

445
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,580
to the North Prince.

446
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,060
Turns out you were
making yourself sound better.

447
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,100
Shame on you.

448
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,980
The coward is just what I appear to be.

449
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,220
I've been trying to find a proper chance

450
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,060
to tell you who I am.

451
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,180
It's indeed what you appear to be.

452
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,940
Actually, you're way too shrewd.

453
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,700
You can even lie perfectly.

454
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,100
If all this hadn't happened today,

455
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,300
I don't think I would ever know.

456
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,260
I'm not good enough for a prince like you.

457
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,180
You're the young princess of Dongyu.

458
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,220
Why are you not good enough?

459
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,940
Young princess of Dongyu?

460
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,140
So, you have known this for a long time.

461
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,940
I just got to know it,

462
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,340
Yueling.

463
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,180
Yueling?

464
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:28,050
♪Watching the stars rise and fall♪

465
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:32,870
♪My eyes are red from missing you♪

466
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:38,030
♪Tonight, I hope the moonlight will♪

467
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:41,700
(Benign and Benevolent)

468
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,340
Your Grace, you're back.

469
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,100
Your Grace, what happened?

470
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,460
Share the fresh milk cake with everyone.

471
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,900
But didn't you keep it for Wen Yu?

472
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,380
Not at all.

473
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,260
He fooled me for such a long time.

474
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,420
From Dongyu to Beishuo.

475
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,540
I'm just the silly young princess of Dongyu.

476
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,820
Your Grace, what are you talking about?

477
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,020
I'm quite confused.

478
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,020
Didn't you say

479
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:22,180
you and Wen Yu lived and died together,

480
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,620
he escorted you here

481
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,460
and you had feelings?

482
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,500
Why has everything changed after you're back?

483
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,820
Will you really not give this to Wen Yu?

484
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,980
- I will.
- I knew it.

485
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,460
I will give it to Wen Yu, the butler.

486
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,140
Not the martial guard.

487
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,540
Butler Wen doesn't like this.

488
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,420
Why don't you give it to me?

489
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,460
What are you waiting for?

490
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,940
Go give it to Wen Yu.

491
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,340
But Your Grace,

492
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,740
Wen Yu is right here.

493
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,780
This is Zhou Shiyu, the North Prince.

494
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,860
What about Wen Yu?

495
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,700
He is Wen Yu, too.

496
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,500
Oh, God.

497
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,140
Yueling, let me explain.

498
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,140
Your Highness,

499
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,180
I'm going to rest.

500
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,060
Excuse me.

501
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,500
You're the young princess of Dongyu.

502
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,620
Why are you not good enough?

503
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,900
Young princess of Dongyu?

504
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,260
So, you have known this for a long time.

505
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,500
I just got to know it,

506
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,140
Yueling.

507
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,260
(The North Prince)

508
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,700
(Wen Yu)

509
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,060
You are him.

510
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,580
(The North Prince, Wen Yu)
And he is you.

511
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,140
Oh, you liar!

512
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,740
Xingyi?

513
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,660
Yueling.

514
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,620
I... I'm wrong.

515
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,980
I won't drink that much ever again.

516
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,940
Hey, you naughty kid.

517
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,660
You stayed out all night

518
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,900
and you drank so much wine, huh?

519
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:51,900
- It hurts.
- Good for you.

520
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,860
You think you've grown up, huh?

521
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,380
- Be gentle.
- Come. Come over.

522
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,420
Be gentle, Yueling.

523
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,140
You think I can't punish you?

524
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,740
- I swear I won't drink again, Yueling.
- Come over.

525
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,660
(The North Prince)

526
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,740
(Wen Yu)

527
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,380
Your Highness, in my opinion,

528
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,660
you're brave, smart, kind, and handsome.

529
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,380
You can do literary and martial arts,

530
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,300
and you are rather celibate.

531
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,140
All the girls will like you.

532
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,500
As long as we do something

533
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,860
to show your strengths,

534
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,060
I believe Her Grace

535
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,660
will be more impressed with you.

536
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,300
Those bad impressions will be gone, too.

537
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,340
(The North Prince, Wen Yu)
Leave this to me, Your Highness.

538
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,460
I'll take care of it.

539
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,060
I believe the two of you will make up

540
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,780
(The North Prince, Wen Yu)
and get even closer.

541
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,220
Qianqian,

542
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,500
what's going on out there?

543
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,100
So noisy in the early morning.

544
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,340
The ladies in the House of Pretties
are moving out, I think.

545
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,700
Moving out?

546
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,380
Are you done with the moving?

547
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,980
- Yes.
- Good.

548
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:02,100
(House of Breeze)

549
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,500
Your Highness,

550
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,700
let me introduce you to the House of Breeze.

551
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:06,860
In this house are

552
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,020
precious paintings and instruments
from different states.

553
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,380
Here is the key for you.

554
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,260
According to His Highness,

555
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,340
you'll be the master of this house.

556
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:17,500
House of Breeze?

557
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,740
Isn't it the House of Pretties?

558
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,860
The ladies have moved out?

559
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,700
The House of Pretties?

560
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,660
I've never heard about such a house

561
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,580
in this mansion.

562
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,620
Your Highness, you must remember it wrong.

563
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,940
But you introduced that to me.

564
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,420
Wrong memory, I'm sure.

565
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,620
(House of Breeze)

566
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,940
(Memorial to the Throne)

567
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,940
Your Highness,

568
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,980
Her Highness went to the House of Breeze.

569
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,380
She was too surprised

570
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,860
to see the plaque.

571
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,020
It's nothing

572
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,740
like the House of Pretties.

573
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,540
(Extremely lecherous.)

574
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,700
Be careful, everybody.

575
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,980
These are

576
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,940
only one-tenth of the precious books

577
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,340
His Highness has kept.

578
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,220
Yueling.

579
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,700
So many books are out there.

580
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,140
Your Highness, the books are everywhere.

581
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,340
What is this custom?

582
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,100
Why do they dry the books
everywhere in the yard?

583
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,500
His Highness could read when he was two

584
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,380
and write articles when he was five.

585
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,020
In Beishuo, His Highness is

586
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:21,660
the most knowledgeable, talented,

587
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,220
intelligent,

588
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,740
and courageous man.

589
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,860
His Highness is amazing!

590
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,980
They talk so loudly

591
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,980
that nearly everybody here can hear.

592
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,380
Your Highness, I guess it's for Her Grace.

593
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:38,380
And it's quite effective.

594
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,060
I can even memorize it.

595
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:45,220
Intelligent and courageous.

596
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,140
That's right.

597
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,460
The Confucian classics
of the collector's edition

598
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,580
must be laid on the desks.

599
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,300
Your Highness, the book drying
in the eastern yard

600
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,820
has been done.

601
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,180
Now, everybody there speaks highly

602
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,500
of your knowledge.

603
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,980
Even Her Highness

604
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,780
has been praising you.

605
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,060
Good.

606
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,060
(Unambitious and useless.)

607
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,900
Greetings, Your Grace.

608
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,340
Our village was hit hard by the plague.

609
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,460
Thanks to the North Prince
who helped us with his man,

610
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,940
we survived.

611
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,180
All these years, we haven't
had a chance to thank him.

612
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,340
Please accept this present.

613
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:27,220
The North Prince gave me some land,

614
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,540
so I settled down

615
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,060
and was no longer a homeless guy.

616
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,100
Today, I'm here to thank His Highness.

617
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,140
Please give him my regards.

618
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,860
I used to be a mere vendor.

619
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,020
My business was poor

620
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,900
because a street gangster bullied me.

621
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,820
The North Prince expelled him,

622
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,300
so I managed to continue my business.

623
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,980
I'm here to thank Your Highnesses.

624
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,500
Your Grace, today, at least dozens of people

625
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,100
expressed gratitude
to the North Prince through you.

626
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,260
Looks like he isn't a very bad guy.

627
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,620
Instead, he's very kind-hearted.

628
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:03,020
Very kind-hearted?

629
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,420
Your Highness, everything's done.

630
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,420
I heard Her Highness

631
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,140
praise you for being kind-hearted.

632
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:18,220
(Scheming.)
Next, count on me.

633
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,020
(Benign and Benevolent)

634
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,580
- So many fancy dishes.
- Give them to me.

635
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,820
- Let me help you.
- All right.

636
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,820
Wow, so many dishes.

637
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,700
Yueling, look.

638
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,900
Come on. Taste this.

639
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,740
- It's for all of you.
- Here.

640
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:34,900
Did the North Prince arrange all this?

641
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,620
Exactly.

642
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,940
His Highness had all this prepared

643
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,380
for you, Your Highness.

644
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,620
Does it satisfy you, Your Highness?

645
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,620
I knew it.

646
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,660
Why do you always haunt me?

647
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,220
Aren't you tired after all this?

648
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,060
Didn't you say everything was done?

649
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:00,620
I really heard Her Highness
was no longer angry.

650
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,100
Heard?

651
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,540
Don't think I'll forgive you for this.

652
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,320
Turned the House of Pretties
into the House of Breeze.

653
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,500
You think I lost my memory?

654
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,500
- And...
- I...

655
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,420
Your men laid the books everywhere around me,

656
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,580
praising you loudly for your intelligence

657
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,700
and courage.

658
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,220
That was really noisy.

659
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,340
- But...
- What's worse,

660
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,540
a lot of people came to thank you.

661
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,460
A real kind-hearted man
never accepts pay for a kindness.

662
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,660
Don't you understand?

663
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:26,180
Quite a lot of people.
I had to give them something back.

664
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,520
I was quite exhausted!

665
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,540
Your Highness...

666
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,140
Linmu,

667
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,500
look what you've done.

668
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:49,900
Your Highness, I...

669
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,380
Your Highness, something must have gone wrong.

670
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,740
Her Highness wasn't this angry before.

671
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,540
I shouldn't have counted on you.

672
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,380
Your Highness.

673
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,390
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

674
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,260
Assassins.

675
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,860
Assassins.

676
00:33:41,681 --> 00:33:47,841
♪Clouds slowly float across the sky♪

677
