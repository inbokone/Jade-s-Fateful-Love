00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.920
The border has got chaotic again lately.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.690
The Taxila Tribe of Dongyu

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.480
keeps harassing our people on the border.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.250
I guess they'll pick another fight.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.400
In this case,

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.890
I'm afraid our foxy uncle will be impatient.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.480
The marriage thing is settled.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.010
There's no point
in killing the Princess of Dongyu.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.920
They will do something else

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.960
to start a war again.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.520
Without a war,

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.680
they couldn't have command

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.410
over politics and military.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.130
What do you think we should do, Shiyu?

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:35.800
Conserve strength

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.010
and fight back in full force.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.850
Things in Yingzhou and Taizhou go smoothly.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.640
I will go to Liuzhou personally

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.050
to help you gather private soldiers

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.290
and contact all forces for more power.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.330
Shiyu,

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.200
your trip to Liuzhou must be dangerous.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.080
I worry that...

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.570
If the war
between the two states really starts,

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.170
our people will suffer

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.450
and our court will be turbulent.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.680
More people will be victims.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.920
I don't want to wait anymore.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.960
Shiyu, we need a more careful plan.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.100
(Benign and Benevolent)

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.640
Yueling, what is wrong?

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.520
You've been upset lately.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.410
I'm bored.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.250
Bored?

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.920
Yueling, wait for me.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.410
Yueling, look.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.920
Look at this, Yueling.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:51.410
The wind blows.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.080
And this.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.040
This one is awesome.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.450
How about this? Look.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.200
Oh, this.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:11.410
Yueling,

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:12.890
what do think of this painting?

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.360
Is it Dongyu?

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.960
Yes.

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.850
I bought this painting

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.240
just because it looked
so much like our hometown.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:31.880
Yueling, you have no idea.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.920
As far as I know,

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.320
the painter is an extremely famous scholar

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.090
all over Beishuo.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.650
He can play music, chess, and paint.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.480
All kinds of arts. Really perfect.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.170
Stories about him travel really fast.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.880
Can someone really have such erudition?

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.720
Yes.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.290
I hear every day, scholars visit Nanfeng House

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.000
where he is dwelling.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.530
Even his door is thronged.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:52.970
I want to see him, too.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.850
So do I.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:56.690
You want to see him?

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.730
No time like the present.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.050
Let's go now.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.610
- Now?
- Yes.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:06.560
Fine, then.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:23.250
Yueling,

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.210
Mr. Perfect who can do all kinds of arts

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.050
lives right here.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.650
(Nanfeng House)
I hear his paintings are worth a bundle.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:28.800
Many dignitaries

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.980
take pride in having his paintings.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.970
A bundle?

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.090
How much did you spend?

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.680
Not very much.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:43.610
Zhang, look at the lines.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:44.770
Quite vigorous.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:45.610
Indeed.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.920
Impressive.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.650
What a lively place!

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.610
I think these people

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.050
all came here for Mr. Perfect.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.290
Mr. Perfect paints so perfectly

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.210
with deep artistic conceptions.

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.050
Yeah.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.360
This Painting of Mountains

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.440
vigorously portrayed verdant trees.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.770
The mountains and trees rise layer upon layer.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:11.800
Really amazing.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:13.480
Amazing.

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:19.120
Good.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.680
Look, the mountains are tall and big.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.850
The trees are numerous and dense.

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.770
Really wonderful.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.320
Yueling,

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.120
since when could you comment on a painting?

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.290
They all comment here.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.240
If we only watch instead of speaking,

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:44.530
we'll look rather ignorant.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.090
That's right.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.000
It's wise of you.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.000
This Painting of River

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.530
has a delicate and majestic composition.

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:59.170
Quite extraordinary.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.730
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.050
Indeed.

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.170
Look at the river.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.050
It's long and broad.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.410
That's right.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.850
Look at the water. So much water.

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.240
Isn't it brilliant?

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:13.290
Can you even appreciate paintings?

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:14.240
What are you talking about?

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:15.560
Such a buzzkill.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.000
Come on. Let's go somewhere else.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.360
Why?

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.480
Your Grace, I think you have a good point.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.320
It's all right.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.320
Ignore them.

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.320
They just don't appreciate paintings.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:28.450
Yeah.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.210
So much water, indeed.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.730
What are you laughing at?

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.170
Miss, you're quite interesting.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:41.050
May I invite you

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:42.680
to have a talk in the tearoom?

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:44.650
Hey, who are you?

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.250
Why do you only invite my sister?

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:47.090
Besides,

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:49.170
we're here to see the famous Mr. Qin.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.530
(Qin Siyuan, Mr. Perfect)
I am Qin Siyuan.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:58.240
So, you're Mr. Perfect?

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:19.610
Enjoy the tea, please.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:22.050
Thanks.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.650
Mr. Perfect,

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:25.800
have you ever visited Dongyu?

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:27.890
No.

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:29.480
Then how did you paint

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.050
the superb scenery of Dongyu?

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:33.890
Well,

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:35.410
I have something for reference.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.410
There are also grasslands in Beishuo?

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:41.890
Mr. Perfect,

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.840
what did you use for reference

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.050
to paint the same grassland in Dongyu?

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.770
Can you show me?

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.520
It's right in the backyard.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.820
(Mild Weather and Bright Scenery)

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.370
Tent?

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:06.010
Nest?

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.130
I've never been to a grassland.

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:09.330
I just

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:11.050
copied the scenery casually.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.600
What about the Painting of Mountains
and the Painting of River?

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.010
(Mild Weather and Bright Scenery)

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:19.840
This is the Painting of Mountains.

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:26.920
Here, the Painting of River.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:31.130
Well,

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:32.650
it's just a stinking ditch in my backyard.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.560
Mr. Perfect, you're really special

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.260
and creative.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.040
You flatter me.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.170
Just some small tricks.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.490
Don't bother.

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:51.980
(Pleasant and Harmonious)

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:53.210
Your Highness.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:54.720
Deliver this to the eastern yard.

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:56.010
I can't, Your Highness.

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:57.320
Her Highness isn't in now.

00:09:58.410 --> 00:09:59.290
She isn't?

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.440
Where is she, then?

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.440
In Nanfeng House

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.680
where Mr. Qin Siyuan dwells.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.250
Oh, Your Highness, do you know?

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:05.650
Mr. Qin Siyuan

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:07.720
is the most elegant young man in town.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.050
Her Highness is there for him.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.080
Your Highness, you're just back.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:13.960
Where are you going again?

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.200
It's getting late.

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:16.290
I'm going to get her back.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.050
Your Highness, wait for me.

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:23.200
Your Highness, you've just recovered.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.560
Have more nutritious food.

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:29.560
Before I think of a way

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.490
to break up Zhou Shiyu
and the Princess of Dongyu,

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:32.920
how can I be in the mood to eat?

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:35.800
Take the dishes away.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:36.650
Come on, Your Highness.

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:38.370
Food is fuel for humans.

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:40.130
You have to eat something.

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:43.090
Wait, wait.

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:44.130
Look.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.370
His Highness has lost weight.

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.410
Yeah, Your Highness.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.840
If you keep losing weight,

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:54.320
it'll be the neglect of our duty.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.080
I've lost weight?

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:00.170
I can't let it be.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:02.080
My gorgeous face

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.010
can't be harmed.

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:05.490
Get the dishes to me.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.410
Sure, Your Highness. Enjoy the food.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:12.840
Your Highness,

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.530
the Princess of Dongyu
you asked us to keep an eye on

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:15.680
went to Nanfeng House earlier today.

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:16.680
The North Prince went there, too.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:17.650
They did?

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.440
Finally, I don't need to think hard

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.410
about how to break them up.

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:27.290
Zhou Shiyu,

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.650
you give me the chance.

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:34.320
Still eating?

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:35.960
What are you? A pig?

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:36.960
Let's get to business.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.050
Girls, don't waste the food.

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:40.890
Eat it up.

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:41.820
Don't lose weight.

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:43.200
- Thank you, Your Highness.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.290
Your Highness, wait for me.

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:46.290
- Your Highness.
- I'll eat this.

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.900
(Nanfeng House)

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.170
This painting is also made
with the reference of my backyard.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:56.920
Actually, it's easy to paint.

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.490
If you're interested, Miss,

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:00.490
I can teach you.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.400
All right.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.080
The paintings are good,

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.770
but they don't have souls.

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:08.650
What are you doing here?

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:13.200
Different people enjoy various things.

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:15.680
They just have different tastes.

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:17.680
You're right, Mr. Qin.

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:19.720
You can have different tastes.

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:23.890
But you must not take away
what someone else loves.

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:27.370
Really?

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.410
It's getting late.

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:29.490
Let's get back home soon.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:37.330
Mr. Qin,

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.770
that seems to be the carriage
from the North Prince's mansion.

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:41.650
Who's that richly dressed man?

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:42.890
The North Prince.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.320
Why did you pull me away?

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.980
I wasn't done enjoying his paintings yet.

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:49.820
His paintings are really...

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:51.530
Since when were you so interested in paintings?

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.770
Why can't I be interested in paintings?

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:56.770
What are you actually interested in,

00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:57.840
the paintings or the painter?

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:01.290
Mr. Perfect.

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:04.050
I'm really here to see the paintings.

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:05.370
The grassland he paints

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:06.920
really looks like that in my hometown.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:07.850
See the painting?

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:09.020
Then next, will you

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:10.720
learn to paint from Mr. Perfect?

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:13.640
Yes.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.250
I'll learn to paint from him.

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:47.890
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:51.490
Don't stand on ceremony.

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:04.290
You're still such a handsome painter.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.560
Nearly as handsome as me.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.170
You flatter me, Your Highness.

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:14.090
Siyuan,

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.050
recently,

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.010
I've had a problem.

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:20.840
Your Highness, I'm indebted to you.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.920
So, I'm ready to help you.

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:36.410
Su Nian, that Dongyu man came again.

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:38.650
Will you be dressed up again?

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.250
No.

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:42.200
That man is really weird.

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:45.840
I don't know what he wants to do today,

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:47.170
watch a dance or do martial arts?

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:50.960
He's rather interesting, I think.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:52.680
Su Nian,

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:55.130
look what I’ve brought you.

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:59.680
Xingyi, what are these?

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:03.290
Blade, spear, and sword.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.650
Hammer and whip.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.410
Even a stick.

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:13.370
Do I have to use all of them?

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.320
Yeah. To do great martial arts,

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.200
you need a weapon you can use best.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.040
Pick one.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.440
Thank you, then.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.890
What weapon do you use?

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:27.850
Me?

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:29.440
I don't need a weapon anymore.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.250
Oh, Lingxi. You pick one, too.

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:32.370
I can teach you.

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:34.650
No, thanks.

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:37.050
Obviously, there are
too many kinds to choose from.

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:39.130
Well, I'll leave the weapons here.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:40.800
You take your time.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.250
I should go back now.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.400
Now?

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.680
Yes.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.530
I had meant to teach you martial arts.

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:50.010
But my sister invited Mr. Perfect

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:51.490
to paint in our mansion.

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:52.890
I have to go have a look.

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:54.560
Mr. Perfect.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.600
Is it really a name for someone?

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.460
Yes.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.410
The one living in Nanfeng House.

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:07.800
Mr. Qin Siyuan, huh?

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:09.410
Yes, it's him.

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.490
Now, he's my sister's art teacher.

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.960
Mr. Qin's paintings are indeed marvelous.

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:16.720
I admire him a lot.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:20.600
But I haven't got a chance to consult him.

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:22.130
You also want to see him?

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.320
That's easy.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.280
Count on me.

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.340
(Everything is going smoothly.)

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.440
Your Highness.

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:49.770
What?

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.920
Her Highness's yard is lively again.

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:55.650
Is she drunk again?

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:56.760
No.

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:58.010
Oh, good.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.280
Your Highness,

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.440
Her Highness is learning to paint from Mr. Qin.

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:03.920
Learning to paint?

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.560
Her Highness paints so well, huh?

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:18.880
Impressive, isn't it?

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:20.530
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:23.450
Great, isn't it?

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.840
Her Highness is really talented.

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:26.730
Xingyi,

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:29.210
why are you painting a tilting tree?

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:33.210
This tree

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:35.730
is just tilting in the wind.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:38.530
I think Mr. Xingyi's tree

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:40.490
is nearly blown away by the wind.

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:42.880
Wonderful. Wonderful indeed.

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:44.800
You have such a good eye for it.

00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:47.800
Wonderful. Wonderful indeed.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.800
Miss Su Nian, you paint so beautifully.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.530
Your tree looks good, too.

00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:58.210
You use easy lines,

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:00.010
but it gives an exquisite refinement.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.690
- Of course.
- Of course.

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:04.560
Speaking of refinement,

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.320
no one can do better than me.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.490
The South Prince is here.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.400
Don't bother to greet me.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.050
You may go on.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:14.160
Your Highness?

00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:15.840
What are you doing here?

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:20.250
I hear you love to paint lately.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:21.690
Then, I have to come.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.970
In Beishuo, speaking of painters,

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.200
Qin...

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.290
Mr. Qin is the best.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.080
Then I'm only second to him.

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:34.600
You can paint?

00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:36.530
What are you talking about?

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.360
Xingyi, come on. Hurry.

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:00.400
Look at this.

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:01.970
Look at the chick.

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:04.490
Is it actually a hen?

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:07.800
He said Mr. Qin was the best painter

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.010
and he was the second best.

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:10.690
He really bragged.

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:12.730
It looks awful.

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.010
Don't laugh.

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:14.970
You have no taste at all.

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:15.810
Go away.

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:19.640
I painted it with utmost effort.

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:21.800
I named it,

00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:25.250
the Painting of Eagle.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.800
Mr. Qin, what do you

00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:47.640
think of this painting?

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:50.890
Wonderful.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.530
Wonderful, indeed.

00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.400
Mr. Qin, did you see his painting?

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:57.850
Wonderful.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.400
Wait.

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:03.600
That's what you just said about my painting.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.010
Your Highness, the South Prince is here.

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.200
I saw him.

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:15.320
Shall we go have a look?

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:20.690
Mr. Qin said my painting was wonderful.

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.320
My painting

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.120
isn't like your poor ones.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.730
Hey, what's your look?

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:28.080
Mr. Qin, look at her painting.

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.360
A boring painting of the landscape.

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.800
And this tilting tree...

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:35.810
Awful.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:40.160
This...

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:41.320
A bald tree.

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:43.330
So pale.

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:46.210
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:47.550
- Can't you comment nicely?
- Can't you comment nicely?

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:49.320
- What a man!
- Then don't comment.

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:50.160
Your...

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:52.880
Your wild eagle is fierce-looking.

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:54.490
Wonderful, huh?

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.970
But look closely.

00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:59.360
This isn't an eagle.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.160
This is actually a chick.

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.000
That's right.

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:06.080
And look down here. Some rice.

00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:07.290
I think

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:11.690
it should be Chick Pecking at the Rice.

00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:26.580
Chick Pecking at the Rice!

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:28.080
Oh, Chick Pecking at the Rice!

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:28.930
Where is Zhou Shiyu?

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.140
Get him to me.

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:31.680
- Oh, Chick Pecking at the Rice!
- Oh, Chick Pecking at the Rice!

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:32.930
Where is he?

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:36.250
- Oh, Chick Pecking at the Rice!
- Oh, Chick Pecking at the Rice!

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:37.450
Zhou Shiyu,

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:38.880
can't you see your brother is here?

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:44.770
- Oh, Chick Pecking at the Rice!
- Oh, Chick Pecking at the Rice!

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.580
(Account Book)

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:16.970
Prime Minister.

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:25.780
(Account Book)

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:31.960
Good.

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:34.130
Good job.

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:36.850
Good.

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:43.560
Very good.

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.400
Any word from Nan Xun?

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.080
No trace of illegal weapons has been found.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.050
Nan Xun stalks them for a while,

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:55.880
only to find they make iron ore just for sale.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.210
If the North Prince only makes iron ore

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:00.800
to accumulate wealth,

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:02.600
we don't need to fear.

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:06.250
It's still too early

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.770
to come to this conclusion.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.200
Go.

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.050
Ask Yang Xu to stick to our plan.

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:18.770
Yes.

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:33.530
Great.

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:35.850
Awesome.

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:38.290
Really awesome!

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:44.060
(Hall of Politics)

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:45.120
(Memorial to the Throne, Account Book)

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:47.600
Recently, I've received a letter of accusation.

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:50.320
Reading it, I felt bitterly disappointed

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:52.080
and utterly shocked.

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.690
I have to present it to you, Your Majesty.

00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:58.740
(Memorial to the Throne, Account Book)

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:05.360
His Highness held an account book, I think.

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:07.450
You're sharp-eyed, censor.

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:10.530
But this isn't an ordinary account book,

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:13.800
but something that can show
the North Prince's intention

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.840
of rebellious schemes.

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:17.530
Rebellious schemes?

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:18.970
Oh, rebellion.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:20.560
That's a capital offense.

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:24.210
In Taizhou and Yingzhou, the North Prince

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:26.690
makes illegal iron ore and forge weapons.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.250
He wants to rebel.

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:31.700
(Memorial to the Throne)

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:33.890
North Prince,

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:36.010
is that true?

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:38.490
For your information, Brother,

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:40.690
I do have two illegal iron mines.

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:43.800
But I don't have them for illegal weapons.

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.730
In recent years, actually,

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:47.080
I've been overspending.

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.250
So, I want more money for living expenses.

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:51.120
Nonsense.

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:52.770
If you need money,

00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:54.640
you can do many other businesses.

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:56.210
Why do you do the iron mining

00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:58.800
that is expressly forbidden?

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:01.360
South Prince, don't you also

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:04.050
do illegal salt trades?

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.080
Why can you do an illegal business

00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:08.400
while I can't?

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:13.050
I do illegal salt trades for money

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:15.010
while you want to rebel.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.840
They're totally different things.

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.730
So, you admit you do illegal salt trades?

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:19.570
You...

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.290
Zhou Shiyu, you set me up?

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.730
I shouldn't have done the same thing

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:28.600
as the South Prince just to get more money.

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.600
I deserve any punishment.

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:31.800
Your Majesty,

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:34.120
please punish the South Prince and me.

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:35.400
Zhou Shiyu,

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:37.640
don't get me involved.

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:39.490
Shiyu confessed his sin.

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.640
Chenyu, you still deny it?

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.450
I can confess.

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.840
But I'm only greedy for money.

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.600
A small punishment will do.

00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:52.210
But the North Prince wants to rebel.

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:55.360
And here is the evidence
of his illegal iron mines.

00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:58.400
Brother, do punish him for treason.

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:01.250
Brother is wise enough to decide.

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:03.530
Or do you want to usurp his authority

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:05.120
and make a decision for him?

00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:07.640
In contrast,

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:10.010
it's really obvious which of us

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:11.930
wants to rebel.

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.010
Don't try to implicate me.

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:16.600
You implicated me first.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:17.450
- You...
- Enough.

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:19.440
My brothers,

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:20.730
look at you.

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.360
One does illegal salt trades

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:23.930
while the other has illegal iron mines.

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:25.530
As important officials,

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:27.120
how could you make such mistakes

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:28.530
just for selfish desires?

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:32.530
For the sake it's your first crime,

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:36.450
you'll each get 50 floggings
in the Ministry of Punishments

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:37.770
and your salary of six months will be deducted.

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:40.490
- But Brother, I...
- Duly noted, Brother.

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.360
I accept the punishments.

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:47.450
Duly noted, Your Majesty.

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:48.690
I accept the punishments, too.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:55.720
Your Grace.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:56.970
Your Grace.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:58.160
Your...

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:01.970
Take it easy. Slow down.

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.490
The North Prince...

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:05.930
He was reported by the South Prince

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:09.690
for the account book or the rebel thing.

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:12.970
Anyway, His Majesty had him flogged.

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:14.130
Account book?

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.930
Your Grace, what are you looking for?

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.600
This is where I kept the account book.

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.010
Why is it gone?

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.360
How... How come?

00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:37.450
Oh, no.

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:39.080
The account book must be the reason.

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:45.400
Who on earth stole it?

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:48.900
(Pleasant and Harmonious)

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:51.320
Your Highness, shortly
after the use of the ointment,

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:52.600
your hips bleed again.

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.360
It must hurt a lot.

00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:56.610
It doesn't matter.

00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:58.360
The executor in the Ministry of Punishments

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:00.010
is really merciless.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.530
He flogged you so hard.

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:04.400
If he hadn't,

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:07.010
how could Uncle believe this?

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:09.680
Shiyu.

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.160
Shiyu.

00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:15.610
Shiyu.

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:17.360
Hearing you're injured,

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:18.400
I came

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.360
with the best ointment.

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:21.690
Thank you.

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:26.160
Shiyu, are you still mad at me?

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.880
I was too childish before.

00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:29.770
Shiyu, you don't feel very well today.

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:31.970
Don't get angry with me.

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:38.320
Shiyu, this is the special ointment
from the south of the Five Ridges.

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:40.160
It promotes blood circulation perfectly.

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.400
(I don't think he needs my ointment.)

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:51.290
Your Highness?

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:56.450
Why didn't get in, Your Highness?

00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:00.560
I was just about to get in.

00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:02.210
What about Your Highness?

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:03.530
How is he now?

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:05.640
Look.

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:07.160
A mass of blood.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:08.770
I can't help feeling sorry.

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:12.640
Princess Luoyi brought some ointment.

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:17.250
Your Highness, Her Highness is here.

00:30:19.050 --> 00:30:19.890
Get her in.

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:24.160
Your Highness, His Highness is waiting for you.

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.160
You just get in.

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:26.970
All right.

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:41.290
Oh, my future cousin-in-law.

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:42.880
My cousin is so badly injured.

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:44.290
What took you so long?

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:47.050
Does it still hurt?

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:49.250
Look at him.

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:50.400
How does it not hurt?

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:51.960
Also,

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:53.010
I'm talking to you.

00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:54.290
Why do you not reply?

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:55.130
Luoyi,

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.360
it's getting late.

00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:59.360
You should get back to the palace.

00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:03.250
Shiyu, let me stay tonight.

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:05.530
Then I can take care of you.

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:06.530
You just go.

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:08.600
- I have...
- He has me.

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:11.010
You'd better leave early, Luoyi.

00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:12.160
It's getting late, after all.

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:13.440
You...

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.560
How can you stay with him?

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.840
Why can't I?

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.770
I'm his bride-to-be.

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:22.920
That's right.

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.050
She'll take care of me.

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:25.320
You don't need to worry.

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:26.680
Linmu.

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:30.080
Walk Princess Luoyi back to the palace.

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:32.330
Yes, Your Highness.

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.250
There you go, Your Grace.

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:52.080
I'll count on you, Your Highness.

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.930
Your Highness.

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:06.800
Your Highness, I'll be gentle.

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.050
The flogging didn't kill me.

00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:10.800
But you nearly did.

00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:15.190
His Highness is miserable.

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:18.720
Your Highness.

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:20.250
Be gentle.

00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:27.690
Yang Xu, get out of here.

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:30.160
It's all because of your awful idea.

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.560
My brother has never flogged me before.

00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:35.050
Don't be angry, Your Highness.

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:37.360
This is the ointment for blood circulation.

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:38.970
You have to bear the paint.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:42.690
Out there, I have to bear Zhou Shiyu.

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:45.320
Back at home, I still have to bear.

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:46.800
Why?

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:49.210
Be gentle!

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:53.770
Your Highness.

00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:03.770
Yueling, what are you thinking?

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:10.640
It must be hurting a lot.

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:12.000
Yeah.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.770
My brother showed no mercy.

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:31.140
(Healing)

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.450
Yueling, you brought me some ointment, huh?

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:36.290
No.

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:40.210
(Healing ointment)
So, is this ointment

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.730
not for me?

00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:45.400
It's for you.

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:49.050
But it's just an ordinary ointment.

00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:51.320
Not as good as what Princess Luoyi gave you.

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:55.640
But I think this is the best.

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:10.890
Sorry.

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.280
I failed to keep the account book.

00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.450
So, you were reported and flogged.

00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:20.450
You also planned to report me, didn't you?

00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:23.640
I didn't know you were the North Prince.

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:25.240
If I had known that,

00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:26.890
I wouldn't have tried to report you.

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:29.760
If it was me,

00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:32.410
you would never turn me in, right?

00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:45.530
Come on.

00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:47.480
I'm all right.

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:48.960
I don't blame you.
