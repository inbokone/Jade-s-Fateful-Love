It's... It's the prefect.

Come on. Take a look.

Gentleman, you can get a good bargain.

00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,880
What is this?

34
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,440
Good eye, gentleman.

35
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,090
This is the compass.

Thirty taels, please.

43
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,690
Thirty taels?

44
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,600
Too expensive.

45
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,210
I won't take it, then.

46
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,490

47
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,360

You...

50
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,940
Even the cost is higher.

51
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,500
I won't take it, then.

00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,020
Come on, gentleman.

53
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,820
Fine, you can have it.

Come more often to buy something from me.

55
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,820
Did I offer too much?

56
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,700
I should have offered less.

57
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,060
Thank you, gentleman. Welcome again.

58
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,060
Someone's killed!

59
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,300
That female assassin.

60
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,380
- Go after her.
- After her.

61
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,060
Where's she?

62
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,260
How did she run so fast?

00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,100

00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,180
Su Nian, it's me.

68
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,060
Mr. Xingyi, there you are.

69
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,220
I'm here to see Su Nian.

70
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,300
She's going to sleep.

71
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,620
How about you come another day?

72
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,740
I have something urgent to ask her.

73
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,780
I can't wait.

74
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,100
Mr. Xingyi.

75
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,260
Today on the West Market,
I met the female assassin again.

76
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,820
She escaped after she was injured.

77
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,800
I followed her all the way here.

78
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,820
You keep talking

79
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,140
about the female assassin.

80
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,580
I'm not interested in her.

81
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,380
It's getting late.

82
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,300
I'm going to sleep.

83
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,700
You should go back.

84
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,460
You're injured.

85
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,180
You still think I'm the assassin?

86
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,940
I followed her here.

87
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,820
Worried about you,

88
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,780
I came in to check on you.

89
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,820
I've been learning a sword dance

90
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,740
but always fail to master it.

91
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,180
When I practiced just now, I was injured.

92
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,820
If you don't believe me

93
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,380
and still suspect me,

94
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,420
go ask the guards to arrest me.

95
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,500
Oh, I see.

96
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,500
Su Nian, how could you be so careless?

97
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:39,820
Let me check your hand.

98
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,500
Come and sit down.

99
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,220
Let me apply some ointment for you.

100
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,460
This will make you feel better.

101
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,860
Oh, no.

102
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,860
How have you been in Liuzhou lately?

103
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,740
I lost my jade pendant for no reason.

104
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,900
What about yours?

105
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,340
Everything's fine with me in the Capital City.

106
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,140
Don't worry.

107
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,500
This will sound normal.

108
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:43,100
(How have you been in Liuzhou lately?)

109
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,740
(She didn't mention
what happened in the palace.)

110
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,860
(How could everything be fine?)

111
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,260
Your Highness, we found the track

112
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,860
of Mr. Shi Xuan near the West Hill.

113
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,100
What about the twenty thousand dan of grain?

114
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,340
Hasn't been found yet.

115
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,460
The grain can't disappear into thin air.

116
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,460
Nie Chen,

117
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,620
take another team

118
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,900
to search for the grain.

119
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,060
Yes.

120
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,260
But more refugees have come.

121
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,140
The remaining grain
can only last one day, I'm afraid.

122
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:23,340
Open my private barn and distribute my grain.

123
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,140
Your Highness, isn't this inappropriate?

124
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,860
People may suspect.

125
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,620
I can't care too much now.

126
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,800
I must give priority to the refugees.

127
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,140
I'm going to the West Hill
to look for Shi Xuan.

128
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,140
Maybe before we find him,

129
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,660
we will not know what exactly happened.

130
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,380
But Your Highness, your injury...

131
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,180
It's all right.

132
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,580
(The North Prince's Mansion)

133
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,900
Come on, Linmu.

134
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,260
Do you have nothing to do?

135
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,500
My duty is to protect you and Her Highness.

136
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,860
I don't need your protection.

137
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,700
Qianqian.

138
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,220
Your Grace.

139
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,620
Has His Highness written back?

140
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,220
Not yet.

141
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,260
Your Grace, a carrier pigeon.

142
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,860
Is it from His Highness?

143
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,380
His Highness was assassinated.

144
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,200
(His Highness was assassinated
in Liuzhou, but he was all right.)

145
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,430
(His return journey will be postponed.)

146
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,700
(Have our guards stay alert just in case.)

147
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:52,980
Make way.

148
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,660
- Go search over there.
- Yes.

149
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,980
- You guys go there.
- Yes.

150
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,100
General,

151
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,660
what are you doing?

152
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,340
This is the North Prince's mansion.

153
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,500
Your Grace,

154
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,740
are you really going to Liuzhou?

155
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,980
Yes. He can't be safe unless we stay together.

156
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,740
Besiege them.

157
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,780
Imperial guards?

158
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,660
Who allows you to besiege this mansion?

159
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,740
Here's the decree from His Majesty.

160
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,140
The North Prince wants to rebel.

161
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,500
Everyone in his mansion will be grounded.

162
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,020
None of them can leave.

163
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,380
Rebel?

164
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,740
(Hall of Politics)

165
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,580
Your Majesty,

166
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,220
the grain delivered to Liuzhou
was gone for no reason.

167
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,860
The North Prince suddenly had some grain.

168
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,980
Having illegal iron mines and hoarding grain,

169
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,020
it's so clear

170
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,140
that the North Prince wants to rebel.

171
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,620
Prime Minister has a point.

172
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,540
The North Prince had illegal iron mines

173
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,500
and that showed his intention of rebellion.

174
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,020
Your Majesty, it was benevolent of you

175
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,660
to punish him lightly.

176
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,740
Now, he has hoarded grain.

177
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,980
Your Majesty, don't let him go

178
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,500
just for the sake of your brotherhood.

179
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,020
Shiyu is my brother.

180
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,100
And he's using his grain on disaster relief.

181
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,740
This case remains inconclusive.

182
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,740
I need more time to find out the truth.

183
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,140
I think

184
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,500
this case is very clear.

185
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,500
The North Prince is nowhere to be found.

186
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,780
It further proves something wrong.

187
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,980
Even in this case,

188
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,260
there's no conclusive evidence

189
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,140
to prove His Highness's treason.

190
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,100
My fellow lords,

191
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,020
aren't you being too arbitrary?

192
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,660
Your Majesty, as far as I see...

193
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:09,860
Your Majesty.

194
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,460
An emperor must not be soft-hearted.

195
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,980
What the North Prince did is obvious.

196
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,660
As his uncle,

197
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,020
I feel sorry for him with deep regret.

198
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,860
But the national laws

199
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,860
allow no favoritism.

200
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,980
I've learned

201
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,740
your different points.

202
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,580
Now,

203
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,340
the North Prince's Mansion
is sealed at the command of Prime Minister.

204
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,980
I won't deal with the rest

205
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,460
before he's back to the Capital City.

206
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,020
- Your Majesty, you...
- I'm tired.

207
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,460
Say no more about this.

208
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,980
His Majesty still can't make up his mind.

209
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,020
Let's take action.

210
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:36,860
Yes, Prime Minister.

211
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,060
(Benign and Benevolent)

212
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,700
Your Highness.

213
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,620
Your Highness.

214
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,260
I asked a familiar imperial guard

215
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,140
for some information.

216
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:02,380
He said, the twenty thousand dan of grain
delivered to Liuzhou

217
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,620
was gone with Shi Xuan,
the Minister of Revenue.

218
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,260
His Highness took grain
out of his private barn for the refugees.

219
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,020
Isn't that a good thing?

220
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,020
Why do they say he rebelled?

221
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,460
It is a good thing to feed the refugees.

222
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,140
But the problem is
His Highness used his private barn.

223
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,860
So, he was slandered for treason.

224
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,860
Where is he now?

225
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,100
Has he recovered?

226
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,460
His Highness...

227
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,220
He's missing.

228
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:25,860
Oh, no.

229
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,140
I have to go there for him.

230
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,020
I must stay with him.

231
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,140
- Or he...
- Your Highness,

232
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,900
the whole mansion is besieged now.

233
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,340
I don't think we can go out.

234
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,220
Yeah, Yueling.

235
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,060
I just checked around.

236
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,260
Even the back door and the corners

237
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,390
are guarded by the imperial guards.

238
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,260
What do we do?

239
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,380
Oh, you're all here.

240
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,860
I don't need to look for you everywhere.

241
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,580
Your Highness?

242
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,140
How did you get in?

243
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,740
It doesn't matter.

244
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,740
What matters is I'm here to see you.

245
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,620
See me?

246
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,140
Yeah. I'm here to see you.

247
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,860
Now, Zhou Shiyu is in big trouble.

248
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,740
I don't think he can come back.

249
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,540
Why don't you think
about marrying someone else?

250
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,500
Our prince is really charming.

251
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,660
(Talent)
Your Highness,

252
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,900
our prince isn't convicted yet.

253
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,780
What do you mean?

254
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,490
Yeah.

255
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,100
Her Grace will consider
marrying anyone but you.

256
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,300
You'd better leave now.

257
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,740
Or I can't help punching you.

258
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,580
Look.

259
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,980
Look at these shortsighted people.

260
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,700
Under such circumstances,

261
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,740
you're still so ungrateful.

262
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,260
Your princess

263
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,340
can live a great life with me

264
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:26,860
and what's so bad about it?

265
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,020
If I go with you, I can leave here?

266
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,740
Are you powerful enough?

267
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,500
Funny.

268
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,180
In the Capital City, who dares to stop me?

269
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,700
Your Highness, think twice.

270
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,820
I can go with you.

271
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,500
But now I'm the North Princess Consort.

272
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,300
If I go with you,

273
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,900
shouldn't I first see His Majesty
and get rid of the engagement?

274
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,900
- Your Grace.
- Yueling.

275
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,740
Don't do that.

276
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,260
That's good.

277
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,500
You should get rid of it.

278
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,820
I'm taking you to His Majesty now.

279
00:17:59,020 --> 00:17:59,860
Your Highness,

280
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,180
don't fall for it.

281
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,580
Your Grace.

282
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:08,900
You're right.

283
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:11,980
I'm going to the palace with you.

284
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,490
Your Grace.

285
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,480
Your Grace, think before you go.

286
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,740
Yeah. His Highness is coming back soon.

287
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,130
- Think more carefully.
- Yueling, I don't agree.

288
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:17,780
I've made up my mind.

289
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,060
I'll pick him.

290
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,540
You will?

291
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,940
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

292
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,020
- Your Grace.
- Yueling.

293
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,860
All right.

294
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:33,860
Let's go.

295
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,340
- Yueling.
- Your Grace.

296
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,340
Your Majesty,

297
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,180
Princess Ashina Zhu is here to see you.

298
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,740
Isn't she grounded in Shiyu's mansion?

299
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,740
The South Prince brought her here.

300
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,300
I'm not sure why she is here.

301
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,820
Get her in.

302
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,860
Yes.

303
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,020
Greetings, Your Majesty. I'm Ashina Zhu.

304
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,500
I guess you came here so late

305
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,700
for the North Prince, right?

306
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,820
He'll in no case rebel.

307
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,190
Please investigate clearly, Your Majesty.

308
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,500
Why are you sure he won't rebel?

309
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,100
I haven't known him for a long time.

310
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,580
But I believe he isn't as useless or lecherous

311
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,980
as people say he is.

312
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,340
He has helped a lot of civilians

313
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,020
without telling anyone.

314
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,900
The mission in Liuzhou is difficult.

315
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,500
To pacify refugees and distribute grain,

316
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,220
he made every effort,

317
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,980
but no one praised him.

318
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,580
Now, the grain is gone.

319
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,260
Some people can't wait to frame him.

320
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,260
What are they really up to?

321
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,020
Hoarding grain means treason.

322
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,860
What proof do they have?

323
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,020
When others can think of this,

324
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,500
how can the North Prince not consider it?

325
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,780
Even if he knew he would be suspected,

326
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,020
he still distributed his own grain decisively.

327
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,500
And he's been badly injured.

328
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,540
Even I feel aggrieved for him.

329
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,740
Looks like someone cares for him now.

330
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,060
Don't worry, Princess Zhu.

331
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,540
I grew up with him.

332
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,500
I will have this case investigated

333
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,740
to vindicate him.

334
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,820
What do you mean?

335
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,740
Your Majesty, please allow me
to go to Liuzhou for the North Prince.

336
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,060
You get up first.

337
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,060
Please approve, Your Majesty.

338
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,340
Are you saying

339
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,820
you're going to Liuzhou personally?

340
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:45,980
Yes. He and I are engaged.

341
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,740
Now, he's guilty. I can't stay out of this.

342
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,060
How about you check this first?

343
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:08,860
(For the Princess's time, the North Prince
would break off the engagement.)

344
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,460
He asked to break off the engagement with me?

345
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,020
Her Grace said

346
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,740
she would ask for a termination of engagement

347
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,460
and then go back with me, huh?

348
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,100
Why hasn't she come out yet?

349
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,340
Your Highness,

350
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,460
I told you she fooled you.

351
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,100
I'll wait a bit longer.

352
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,740
I'll break them up soon.

353
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,820
Your Highness, let's go back.

354
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,260
Has Her Grace come out?

355
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,300
I just got to know

356
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,980
Her Grace left a long time ago.

357
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,660
What?

358
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,300
I've been waiting here the whole night,

359
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,420
having nothing to eat or sleep.

360
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,580
But she left so quickly.

361
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,420
Fine.

362
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,780
She went too far, huh?

363
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,060
Don't blame me, then.

364
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,020
Your Highness,

365
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:22,180
I told you Her Grace was unreliable.

366
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,660
Shut up. Let's go back.

367
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,540
All right.

368
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:40,500
(Liuzhou)

369
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,940
Wake up.

370
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,740
Philanthropist Wei is here.

371
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:18,020
- Come this way.
- He's here with some grain.

372
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,580
It's for everybody.

373
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,500
Don't squeeze. You'll all have some.

374
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,900
- It's for everybody.
- Take it.

375
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,260
It's yours.

376
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,500
- It's for everybody.
- Take it.

377
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,420
Don't panic.

378
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,540
(Luckily, some philanthropists help people.)

379
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,780
It's for all of you.

380
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,980
- Thank you, Philanthropist Wei.
- Here. Take it.

381
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,260
Greetings, Your Highness.

382
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,500
Where's His Highness?

383
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,420
I heard he was assassinated.

384
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,310
Where is he now?

385
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,420
His Highness has been searching

386
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,500
for the lost Mr. Shi on the West Hill.

387
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,780
You can wait for him here.

388
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,060
Your Highness,

389
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,300
you can't go any farther.

390
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,420
Fight.

391
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,060
Shiyu.

392
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,740
Yueling, what are you doing here?

393
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,780
How's your injury?

394
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,780
It's all right.

395
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,100
(Auspicious and Fortunate)
Where are you keeping Her Grace?

396
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,740
I was waiting the whole night.

397
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,900
Believe it or not, I'll crush...

398
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,940
Crush this house.

399
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:38,800
- Bring it on.
- Come on.

400
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:39,650
Come on. I dare you.

401
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,660
How do you have the nerve to ask?

402
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,020
Since my sister left with you,

403
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:42,800
she hasn't been back yet.

404
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,120
- That's right.
- Where are you keeping here?

405
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,420
Where are you keeping Her Grace?

406
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:45,850
- Yeah.
- Where?

407
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:47,120
Give Her Grace back to us!

408
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:47,970
Where are you keeping her?

409
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,580
Stop playing innocent.

410
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,060
Give me back my future wife!

411
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,350
Nonsense!

412
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,820
- He's playing innocent.
- Yeah. Give her to us.

413
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,660
You know what?

414
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,580
You lost Her Highness.

415
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,740
We should have asked you for her.

416
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,820
What are you yelling for?

417
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,900
Yeah.

418
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,900
How dare you even come?

419
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,100
Rather treasonous. How dare they
talk to me like this?

420
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,740
Shut up and hand over my sister.

421
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,020
- Hand her over.
- Hurry.

422
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,500
- Hand her over!
- Give back Her Highness!

423
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,820
Your Highness, let's go back.

424
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,900
They outnumber us.

425
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,340
Why would we go?

426
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,580
I'm not scared of them.

427
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,260
Your Highness, His Majesty ordered

428
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,260
no outsiders

429
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,780
should approach anyone here.

430
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,740
Please go back to your own mansion.

431
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,540
Am I an outsider?

432
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,300
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

433
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,540
Let's go.

434
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,580
Don't go.

435
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,020
Stay if you dare.

436
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:41,060
Hey, don't go.

437
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,180
Get out of here.

438
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,900
Here's water. And a boat.

439
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,540
Let's go find Mr. Shi Xuan.

440
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,380
All right.

441
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,660
This cave is so dark.

442
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,460
Can the missing Mr. Shi be here?

443
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,740
My men tracked down here,

444
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,100
but didn't find him.

445
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,420
Be careful.

446
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,340
Watch out!

447
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,740
Why are you so badly injured?

448
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,140
I'm fine.

449
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,740
Don't worry.

450
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,260
Yueling,

451
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,220
how come you're here?

452
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,820
Isn't my mansion sealed?

453
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,100
I begged His Majesty.

454
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,620
Did you

455
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,260
read the decree?

456
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,740
Then,

457
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,900
we're no longer engaged.

458
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,980
You don't need to risk your life for me.

459
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,220
Why did you still come?

460
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,900
You once saved my life.

461
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:05,100
I want to save you for this once, too.

462
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:10,340
And you're in trouble now.

463
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,580
Everyone in the Capital City says you'll rebel.

464
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,220
How can I sit around and do nothing?

465
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,700
You don't think I'll rebel?

466
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,180
You won't.

467
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,620
Listen.

468
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,140
Someone's there.

469
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,980
Can it be Shi Xuan?

470
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,740
But there's no more road ahead.

471
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,340
How can we save him?

472
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,020
I have an idea.

473
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,220
Yueling, I think I found him.

474
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,260
Who's he?

475
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,420
Shi Xuan.

476
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,420
Mr. Shi.

477
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,500
Mr. Shi.

478
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,260
Mr. Shi, wake up.

479
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,260
Mr. Shi, it's me.

480
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,100
Your Highness.

481
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,420
Your Highness.

482
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,100
Let's go.

483
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,860
Your Highness,

484
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,020
I failed my duty

485
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:30,180
and lost the hope for Liuzhou people.

486
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,500
I'm too ashamed to leave.

487
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,500
Mr. Shi, you had a hard time.

488
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,100
Can you tell me

489
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,540
how you lost the twenty thousand dan of grain?

490
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,740
Who are you?

491
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,060
You must be Mr. Shi from the Capital City, huh?

492
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,940
I'm Xu Wei, the guard
of the Prefect of Liuzhou.

493
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,020
At the command of the prefect,

494
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,300
I'm here to receive you.

495
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:08,980
Thank you.

496
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,900
Xu Wei.

497
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,460
It's him again.

498
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,980
They not only cheated me of the grain,

499
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,820
but also tricked us up to the hill.

500
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,940
When we were up here,

501
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,900
they revealed their true colors as bandits,

502
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:30,420
killed all the soldiers from the Capital City,

503
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:35,460
and imprisoned me in this cave.

504
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,820
They keep you alive

505
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,220
to set me up, right?

506
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,500
Yes.

507
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,580
They forced me

508
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,140
to write a letter in my blood

509
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,660
to accuse you of treason.

510
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,020
Never would I give in!

511
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:03,540
So, I've been imprisoned here all the time.

512
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,220
These bandits are so evil.

513
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,220
This is not a place to dawdle.

514
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,780
Let's get out of here.

515
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:28,860
Be careful.

516
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:33,060
Slow down.

517
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,540
What's the smell?

518
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,500
Oh, no. Toxic smoke.

519
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,180
Let's hurry.

520
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,020
Yueling.

521
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,500
