Wen Yu,

it's not that I'm scared.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.970
But I have to pretend
to be the Eldest Princess.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.250
I can't die.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.060
So, you might as well

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.380
stay in the room and protect me.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.940

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.290
I'll loosen it.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.340
Then you can sleep on the ground.

Don't say thank you.

- Mr. Xingyi.
- What?

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:33.740
Mr. Xingyi,

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.900
your clothes...

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.820

some clean clothes?

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:38.930

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.410
I won't.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.140
You know what?

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.780
I'll show my sister

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.730
how you guys treated me.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.290
Mr. Xingyi, you get us wrong.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.170
We didn't mean to leave you alone.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.050
It was just an emergency.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:05.340
I left some soldiers there,

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.530
- searching for you.
- You know what?

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:07.780
Don't find excuses.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.260
I came back by myself!

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:10.700
You didn't help at all!

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.220
I had a narrow escape.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.730
I nearly died.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.050
I'll say no more.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.100
Yueling, Yueling!

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.460
Mr. Xingyi.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.860
- Yueling!
- Mr. Xingyi.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:20.930
(Mild Weather and Bright Scenery)

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:21.580
Yueling.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:23.970
Yueling.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.890
- Xingyi?
- Yueling!

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:37.730
Yueling.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.460
You're finally back.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:42.580
Oh,

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.050
how is your injury?

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:45.700
How is it?

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:46.660
It's all right now.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.020
You have no idea

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.690
how miserable I was in the past dozen days.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.580
In the first few days, I was poisoned.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.460
I crawled through the forest on my knees.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.460
In the latter days, I was crippled.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:58.620
I had to walk with a cane.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.740
Yueling,

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.540
it was so cold.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.020
I had nothing to eat, either.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.900
Yueling,

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.140
I really...

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.740
Sorry, Xingyi.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.700
I failed to protect you.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:12.300
Never mind.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.940
Did they give you the antidote?

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:16.460
They gave me the antidote?

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.060
Not at all!

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.740
They discarded me at first.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.220
If I hadn't convinced the female assassin

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.260
with my smart head

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.300
and got the antidote,

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.340
I would have been dead!

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:25.820
Mr. Xingyi,

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.260
I've been explaining this all the way here.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.720
I didn't mean to discard you.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:29.740
I was just in a hurry to return.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.140
How could you still find excuses?

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.060
How could you?

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.060
You know what? They're so unreliable.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.380
Yueling, let's leave here.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.980
Yueling.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.600
(Pleasant and Harmonious)
When we found Mr. Xingyi,

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.940
we ran into assassins of the Roufeng Sect.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:46.020
Later, the reinforcements

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.780
scared them away.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:48.860
We caught only two of them.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.860
But they held some toxins in the mouth

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:52.420
and killed themselves.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:55.300
The Roufeng Sect

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:56.980
nearly sent all their assassins.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.340
They must have been fully prepared.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.820
They even had the route map

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.100
of the escort.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.540
The biggest sect, indeed.

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:08.380
They appeared to assassinate the princess.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.700
But actually, they were against me.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.580
The one behind them

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:15.740
must be a politician.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.300
A politician?

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.260
That explains.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.660
The scout we sent Dongyu for Yueling...

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:24.660
Any word from him?

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.180
Not yet.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.380
Your Highness,

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:30.540
do you not trust Yueling?

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.060
Keep a close eye on her and her brother.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.140
But if they need anything,

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.300
help them as much as you can.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.140
Oh,

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.860
don't let them run away.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.020
I won't.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:52.060
I'll take my leave.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.620
Yueling, the food here is so delicious.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:03.460
Xingyi,

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:06.220
they're friendly to the princess, right?

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.300
These are imperial dishes.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:11.820
Yueling,

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:13.620
you don't want to stay here

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:14.940
and get married, do you?

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:17.580
I can't leave now.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.100
If I do,

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:21.940
Beishuo will put pressure on Dongyu.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:24.540
I'm afraid there will be a war again.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.340
Then the escape of our eldest sister

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.180
will be exposed.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:30.940
That's right.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:33.660
It's thoughtful of you, Yueling.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:35.740
Yes, of course.

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.460
Let's just wait and see.

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:42.300
There are weird local rules.

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:45.100
I guess I won't be summoned lately.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:14.380
Get out of the way.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:24.400
The Prime Minister is back.

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.940
Isn't he suppressing a rebellion in Yongzhou?

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.260
- How come he's back so soon?
- What happened?

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.020
Brother,

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:30.620
I escorted the Eldest Princess of Dongyu

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:31.780
to her mansion.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.020
(Hall of Politics)
Soon, she can come and see you.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:34.980
Brother,

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.260
I heard

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:37.540
the North Prince was assassinated

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.580
on his way back.

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.700
Many of his men were dead or injured.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.140
Even the Princess of Dongyu had a narrow escape

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.460
before she arrived.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:48.180
She nearly died of starvation.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.620
You're hyper-informed.

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.020
But I nearly died of starvation, too.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:55.140
Why haven't you cared about me?

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.020
You look all right now.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.060
And the Eldest Princess of Dongyu matters most.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.340
You should focus on the most important thing.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:04.420
Brother,

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:05.940
I think

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.460
the North Prince is to blame

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.500
for the victims of the escort.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.060
He deserves to be punished

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.860
as a warning.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:14.980
Just because I care
about the most important thing,

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:17.180
I'm advising you

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.900
to stop instructing our brother.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.220
I'm not instructing him.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.020
I'm asking for your punishment.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.340
Zhou Shiyu, don't set me against His Majesty.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.820
Set you against His Highness?

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:31.100
I think that's what you're doing.

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:33.100
With a narrow escape,

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.780
I finally returned to the Capital City.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:36.460
Then someone couldn't wait

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.140
to send his maid to poison me.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:40.300
Poison?

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.820
I wonder who...

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.020
Oh, Brother.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.540
I think

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.180
the Eldest Princess of Dongyu
should be greatly awarded

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.420
to calm her down from the scary trip.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:51.820
You're right, Zhixuan.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:54.460
I also heard

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:55.540
about the assassination thing.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.340
The Princess of Dongyu didn't die.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.500
She was lucky enough to survive.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.780
She is here to get married.

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:06.180
The marriage between the two states
is a happy event.

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:07.700
In this case,

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.980
the North Prince will be exempted

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.140
from his careless protection.

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:14.700
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:16.900
- How could this be?
- Yeah.

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:18.140
This is inappropriate.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:23.140
He can't be redeemed!

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.940
The Prime Minister is back.

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:27.500
Prime Minister.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.500
The Prime Minister is back.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.340
- Prime Minister.
- Oh, Prime Minister.

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:46.540
Your Majesty, I rushed back
to report the success.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:49.140
You won't blame me for offending you,

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.620
will you, Your Majesty?

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.980
You're an important official.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.380
And during the suppression in Yongzhou,

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:01.820
you did really hard work.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:03.700
Your holding a sword in the court

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:04.980
doesn't seem to be wrong.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:10.700
Your Majesty,

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.300
the Prime Minister is meritorious

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:13.860
for the suppression in Yongzhou.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:16.620
How about Your Majesty
follows Emperor Xuan of Xichuan

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.900
to allow important officials
to carry a sword in the court?

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.140
Yeah.

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:25.140
The Prime Minister
is meritorious enough to do this.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.300
Minister Liu has a point.

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:34.840
Then, I will...

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:36.540
Thank you for understanding, Your Majesty.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:41.700
Your Majesty,

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:43.340
I heard

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.700
the Eldest Princess of Dongyu was sent here

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:48.820
to get married

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:51.180
an become one of your consorts.

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:58.100
Dongyu is a small state of minority.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:59.460
Their Eldest Princess

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:02.420
isn't good enough to marry our emperor.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:03.380
That's right.

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:04.220
Yeah.

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:07.940
Uncle, are you saying
we'll break the engagement

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:09.460
and the alliance between the two states?

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:11.700
Shiyu,

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:15.460
I just said Dongyu was small

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:17.340
and their Eldest Princess

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:20.140
wasn't good enough to marry our emperor.

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:23.340
When did I offer to break the engagement?

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.180
And when did I advise

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:27.300
breaking the alliance between the two states?

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.740
If you have an idea, Uncle,

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.220
feel free to talk.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.340
The Eldest Princess of Dongyu

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:36.700
is a princess after all.

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:38.580
She isn't good enough for His Majesty.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:39.580
But

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.820
she can match

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:44.860
one of our imperial family.

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.780
You have a point, Prime Minister.

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:49.020
But I don't think

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:51.380
doing this will reassure Dongyu.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.180
Your Majesty, rest assured.

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.820
The diplomat of the Taxila Tribe, Dongyu,

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.020
and I had crossed paths.

00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:00.020
He will convince the emperor of Dongyu.

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:06.860
Even if the emperor of Dongyu approves,

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:08.980
which one of our imperial family

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:10.020
can be good enough

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:11.900
for the Princess of Dongyu?

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:12.900
Me.

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.220
Brother, I'd like to help you.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:17.980
I heard the Eldest Princess of Dongyu

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:19.900
was the most beautiful lady there.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.020
She should marry me,

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.500
the most handsome man in Beishuo.

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:26.540
Umm...

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.740
Uncle, what do you think?

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:32.660
Your Majesty,

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.260
I think

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:38.540
the North Prince did hard work
to get the princess back.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.980
And he isn't married yet.

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:43.020
How about we marry the Princess of Dongyu

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.500
to the North Prince?

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:47.820
What do you say, Your Majesty?

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.340
- The Prime Minister is so thoughtful.
- Yeah.

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:51.860
I don't think I'm good enough for Her Grace.

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:53.700
Yeah. Let me do it.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:54.820
I'll do it.

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:55.660
All right.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:58.940
We'll do what the Prime Minister advised.

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.460
The Princess of Dongyu
will be married to the North Prince

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:02.940
and the wedding will be held.

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:04.260
Good.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:07.860
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:14.420
I'm your elder brother.

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:16.380
Don't you disrespect me
only because you're the North Prince.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.380
First come, first served.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.620
Even my elder brother can't break the rules.

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.700
Zhou Shiyu, just you wait!

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:26.380
In every morning court, the two princes

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.420
antagonize each other.

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:29.620
His Majesty is weak

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:30.980
and has no children.

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:32.380
If the reign of the imperial family

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:34.700
falls in the hands of the two foppish princes,

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:35.900
it will be risky.

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:38.500
Luckily, in the court,

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.180
the Prime Minister is still in charge.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:41.750
- Yeah.
- If we had to rely on them...

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:45.620
Uncle.

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:46.850
Long time no see.

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:49.530
It's been a long time.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:50.600
Shiyu,

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.780
you've been full of vigor and vitality.

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.740
I'd like to congratulate you.

00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:58.740
Speaking of this,

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:00.420
thank you for recommending me.

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:01.700
So, the South Prince

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.320
failed to marry
the most beautiful lady in Dongyu.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.460
Shiyu, you were brave enough

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:08.860
to get rid of the danger,

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:10.140
come back smoothly,

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:11.420
and get the pretty woman.

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:14.620
All right.

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:15.620
I should go.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:32.740
Your Highness,

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:34.940
all of a sudden,

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.380
why do you have to marry
the Princess of Dongyu?

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:39.700
Uncle pushed it, obviously.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:44.380
But why did he ask you to marry Her Grace

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:45.420
instead of His Majesty?

00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:48.580
Does he want to give you the power of Dongyu?

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:50.660
He can't be that nice.

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:55.300
I guess he'll do something soon.

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:07.500
Our emperor

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:09.300
has really grown up.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.300
When I was away for the suppression,

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.820
he had a private alliance with Dongyu.

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:15.620
I was traveling day and night

00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:17.300
and three great horses died

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.660
before I stopped him
from marrying the Princess of Dongyu.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:21.000
Prime Minister.

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.580
His Majesty has been reigning for three years

00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:24.740
within our restriction in the court.

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:26.340
So, after you left the Capital City,

00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:28.540
His Majesty negotiated with Dongyu,

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:31.300
trying to get their power to impede us

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:32.620
through marriage.

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:34.940
His Majesty wants to marry
the Princess of Dongyu

00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:38.740
without any fear of disappointing us.

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:44.820
He's accumulating his own power.

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:45.460
I don't understand.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.900
(Lin Su, the Prime Minister's counselor)
You always fear the North Prince.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:51.500
Then why did you marry
the Princess of Dongyu to him?

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:55.980
If the Princess of Dongyu

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.340
successfully marries the North Prince,

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:01.860
he'll easily get the power of Dongyu.

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:03.260
But if the princess

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:04.940
fails to marry the North Prince

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.700
and even dies in his mansion,

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:11.900
Zhou Shiyu

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:13.660
will have

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:16.380
a hard time.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.780
Brilliant, Prime Minister.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:22.940
Really brilliant.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:28.780
These days,

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.980
have our men completely repair

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:32.220
the eastern yard.

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:33.420
By the way,

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:35.100
do some decorations

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.780
in the chambers there

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:37.700
according to Dongyu style.

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:39.300
Your Highness,

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:41.540
will you really marry that fake princess?

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:48.780
Whether she's a real or fake princess,

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:50.620
she'll be my real wife after the wedding.

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:51.620
Get used to that early.

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.260
(Mild Weather and Bright Scenery)

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:06.660
Be careful. Careful.

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:07.500
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:18.740
(Catalogue of Gifts)

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.540
A decree for Ashina Zhu.

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:36.420
(Royal Decree)
His Majesty hereby announced this.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:39.700
"I hear Ashina Zhu,
the Eldest Princess of Dongyu,

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:41.260
behaves elegantly

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:42.820
and remains respectful

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:44.220
with a gentle personality

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:45.620
and a beautiful appearance.

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.340
Quite happy to know this,

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:50.930
(Mild Weather and Bright Scenery)
I decided to relate our two states by marriage.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:54.860
Zhou Shiyu, the North Prince,
is over 20 years old

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:57.220
and he should get married.

00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:59.940
He deserves a good girl.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:02.500
Ashina Zhu, the Eldest Princess,

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:06.700
makes a perfect couple with the North Prince.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:08.780
I should help them get together.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:12.620
Hereby, I marry Ashina Zhu to the North Prince.

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:16.500
The wedding will be held in three months
on the national day of Beishuo.

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:18.180
All the ceremony things

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:22.100
will be handled by the Ministry of Rites
and the Bureau of Astronomy."

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:23.710
Respect this.

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:28.300
Yueling,

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.780
they're totally disrespecting our state.

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:31.900
They modified the engagement.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.900
A princess consort can't be
as good as an imperial consort.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:35.940
This is ridiculous.

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:39.300
Yeah.

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:41.180
I didn't see this coming, too.

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:44.340
If our eldest sister suffered this here,

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.220
she wouldn't tell us.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:48.820
Luckily, she left.

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.660
But on the catalogue of gifts,

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:55.340
many more gold, silver, silk, cattle, sheep,
and horses

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:56.540
are given to Dongyu.

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:57.740
With so many things,

00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:59.580
I don't think our people

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:00.940
will complain too much.

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:02.460
They will not complain.

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:03.580
But I have something to say.

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:05.220
You don't get married.

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:09.260
Yueling, I've heard all about it lately.

00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:10.500
The North Prince you're going to marry

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:11.580
isn't a good guy.

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:16.540
Run.

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:18.500
All right.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.300
But we haven't heard
from our eldest sister yet.

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:24.140
Forget it.

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.580
(Mild Weather and Bright Scenery)

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:38.500
The yard in Beishuo looks fancy.

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:40.900
But compared to our grassland,

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.540
it's far inferior.

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:43.380
Yueling!

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:45.100
Yueling!

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:48.660
Yueling, look who is here.

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.780
Your Grace.

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:53.940
Qianqian.

00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:58.050
Your Grace.

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:02.060
I've finally found you, Your Grace.

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:03.940
You have no idea.

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:05.900
Hardly had I got the Eldest Princess settled...

00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.380
Hardly had I got the Eldest Princess settled

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:09.820
than I set out for you.

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:13.140
But it was too far away.

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:15.060
I ran into some refugees on my way

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.100
and was robbed of every penny I had.

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:21.740
I had a hard trip, too.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:24.060
I understand you, Qianqian.

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:28.060
Thank you for your hard work, Qianqian.

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:29.420
Come on.

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.420
How is my sister?

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:34.500
Princess Ashina Zhu and Diplomat Du Er

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:35.860
have settled down in the northwest tribe

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:36.860
of Dongyu.

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:38.700
That's great.

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:40.020
She can finally marry

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:40.900
the man she loves.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.060
Yeah. You can be relieved, Yueling.

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:44.980
Moreover,

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:47.660
the three of us are back together again.

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:49.060
- We're back together.
- Yeah.

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:52.460
Now, what will we do?

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:54.620
Run away.

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:01.900
- Piggy.
- Piggy.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.180
- Come. So cute.
- Good piggy.

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:05.420
Eat some more.

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:07.940
Come to me.

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.620
I'm the most handsome man in Beishuo!

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:15.060
Why can Zhou Shiyu surpass me?

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:17.420
That's right.

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:18.700
Your Highness, you're handsome

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:19.620
and charming.

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:21.860
You're a perfect match
for the Princess of Dongyu.

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:23.300
But His Majesty

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.460
obeys the Prime Minister in every way.

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:29.340
So, we should stay on friendly terms with him.

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:30.860
We should.

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.700
Uncle is temperamental.

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:36.220
I don't dare to mess with him.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:38.260
Is there any other way

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:40.420
to make me marry the Princess of Dongyu?

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.020
Oh.

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:44.940
Your Highness,

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:49.620
if you build a relationship with the princess

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:53.260
before she marries the North Prince

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:57.380
and she asks His Majesty to marry her to you,

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:00.420
maybe there'll be a ray of hope.

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.580
It's a good idea.

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:08.980
Mr. Xingyi.

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:10.180
Mr. Xingyi.

00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:14.540
Why are you here again?

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:17.540
I've brought you something to eat.

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:19.500
Flower-shaped Goose Cake,

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:21.620
Cheese Cherry,

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.380
Sliced Fish in Sauce,

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:24.900
and Roast Quail.

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:28.140
These are the most famous local snacks.

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.260
You haven't tasted any, right, Mr. Xingyi?

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:33.540
Don't think I'll forgive you

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:34.620
just for these snacks.

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:37.700
I get it.

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:39.420
But Mr. Xingyi,

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:40.900
are you

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:44.020
going out?

00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:46.700
No.

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:49.300
I'm just tidying up the room.

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:53.340
I just... I'm a clean man.

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:54.180
What's the problem?

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:56.940
Nothing.

00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:00.100
Who's eating alone?

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:02.020
Yueling,

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.580
Lin Mu brought me these snacks.

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:06.860
I want to check how they taste.

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:08.900
If they taste good, I'll bring them to you.

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:10.900
Really?

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.220
I'll take my leave, then.

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:24.660
Yueling, everything is packed.

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:26.500
Are we leaving today?

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:28.020
Not now.

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.220
We can't leave without a plan

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.540
in case we alert them.

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:34.540
Yueling,

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:36.460
we've been in the Capital City

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:37.620
for quite a long time

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:39.060
but have never gone out for fun.

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:41.340
I heard about the nearby House of Romance

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:42.180
which is quite popular.

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:43.260
How about

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:45.100
you take me there to experience it?

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.260
Yueling, take me there.

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:49.620
Please take me there.

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:50.900
- Yueling.
- Let's go there, then.

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:00.300
Your Highness, Her Grace came out.

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:04.260
At last.

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:06.020
Will we stick to the plan?

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:08.220
- Approved.
- Yes.

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:09.100
Chunhua.

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:10.220
Here.

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:12.860
Get me changed.

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:14.780
I'm going to do something serious.

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:15.940
Yes.

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:23.620
Look.

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:24.660
That one is good.

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:28.140
So pretty.

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.020
You're gorgeous, girl.

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:31.900
How about you have fun with us?

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:33.860
You must have a death wish!

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:36.260
You've just recovered.

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:37.900
They're mere roaches.

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:40.180
I can take care of them.

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:43.500
You sound arrogant.

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.580
Let me teach you how to please a man.

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:47.620
- You have a death wish!
- Stop!

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:56.380
Beat him!

00:26:57.030 --> 00:26:57.940
What's going on?

00:26:57.940 --> 00:26:59.020
What are they doing?

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:01.420
How come they're fighting?

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:21.340
Oh, my ear.

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:32.540
Don't be scared, Miss.

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:34.300
When I'm here,

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:35.740
they won't dare to hurt you.

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:41.300
Gentleman, you have great martial arts.

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:44.780
I certainly do.

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:47.300
I've been practicing martial arts since little.

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.860
In the Capital City,

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:51.620
no one can defeat me.

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:53.940
No one can defeat him.

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:55.900
So impressive?

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:58.740
How about I compete with you?

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:02.660
Oh, I don't know.

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:05.060
I'm a strong man.

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:06.740
How can I fight a girl?

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:07.580
Watch this.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.020
Yueling, stop.

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:12.100
Or you may kill him.

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:13.020
How dare you beat...?

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:14.460
Me.

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:17.820
- Young Master.
- Yang...

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:19.260
- Young Master.
- Yang Xu.

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:20.300
Don't cry, Young Master.

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:21.140
Don't cry.

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:24.020
I thought you were a strong martial artist.

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:25.060
I'm sorry.

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:27.420
I didn't know you were so weak.

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:29.020
Shall I go to the clinic with you

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:30.500
and then walk you home?

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:31.860
However much I have to pay,

00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:33.060
I'll give it to you.

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:33.900
Right.

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:35.820
She...

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:38.260
She even offers some money.

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:41.020
Our young master has something important to do.

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:42.660
We should go.

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:44.900
- Let me walk you.
- Hey, don't go.

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:55.140
This local guy is weird.

00:28:55.140 --> 00:28:56.940
One moment he was rather hospitable

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:58.540
and the next moment, he became indifferent.

00:28:58.540 --> 00:28:59.460
I think

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.260
Beishuo men are just weak.

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:02.500
Without martial arts,

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:04.100
he planned to save you.

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:05.300
I think he just had a great wish.

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:07.420
Forget him.

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.860
- Let's go to the House of Romance.
- All right.

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:12.200
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:13.950
- Calm down, Your Highness.
- Don't be angry, Your Highness.

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:14.820
Your Highness, cool down.

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:16.340
Your Highness, calm down.

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:17.820
Calm down?

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:19.140
Look what you've done!

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:20.300
And you asked me to calm down?

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:21.700
I didn't expect that, either.

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:22.900
Chunhua, Qiuyue, Xiachan, and Dongxue.

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:23.740
- Here.
- Here.

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.100
Punish him.

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:26.300
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:27.460
Your Highness, I...

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:28.860
Oh, Your Highness.

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:29.700
Your Highness.

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:34.100
Your Highness.

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:38.780
Mercy, Your Highness.

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:39.980
Please spare me.

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:41.300
I didn't know the Princess of Dongyu

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.260
could be so tough.

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:43.300
I... I have...

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:44.460
I have another plan, Your Highness.

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:45.260
I still have...

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:47.700
Stop.

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:49.420
Tell me about it.

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:51.140
Come on, Your Highness.

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:53.780
When we fail to get the princess,

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:56.460
we can do something to the North Prince.

00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:57.340
Well, tell me.

00:29:57.740 --> 00:29:58.940
What can we do to him?

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:01.540
Your Highness.

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:08.660
We can...

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.020
Your Highness.

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:22.740
(Invitation)

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:24.660
The South Prince had this sent,

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:27.020
inviting you to talk in the House of Romance.

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:30.140
I'm not going. I have no time for his drama.

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:32.900
I'll go reject him now.

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:35.940
Your Highness.

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:37.580
Miss Yueling is going to escape.

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:40.060
Before that, she has gone
to the House of Romance for fun.

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:45.340
Butler Wen.

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:48.420
Yes, Your Highness.

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:49.660
Don't reject him.

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:50.940
Since the South Prince wants some fun,

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:52.380
let's go have fun with him.

00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:55.620
After all, someone in the palace will love

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.340
the disputes between us.

00:30:58.100 --> 00:30:59.020
Yes.

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:07.060
Tonight, the unsurpassed lady will dance.

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:08.460
It's been a long time

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:10.100
since Miss Su Nian danced last time.

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:11.100
Yeah.

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:13.260
Look, the guests to watch the performance

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:15.380
have more than doubled than usual.

00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.300
How did you get the bruises on your face?

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:25.740
When I came out earlier today,

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:27.460
I fell accidentally.

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:31.610
If you had fallen accidentally,

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.500
you wouldn't have so many bruises.

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:35.620
Unless you were chased by a dog,

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:37.700
you wouldn't be so badly injured.

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:42.940
Then pretend I met a mean dog in the day.

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:45.700
Mean dog.

00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:50.740
Someone cursed me.

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:52.740
Can it be anyone thinking of you?

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:53.580
No.

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:55.300
Someone must have cursed me.

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.100
Never mind.
Look over there. So bustling.

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:01.940
Let's go take a look.

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:04.900
Come in, please.

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:09.380
Today, our unsurpassed lady Miss Su Nian

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:11.300
will dance for the guests.

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:14.000
Let's welcome her.

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:15.060
- Look over there.
- Madam Sang.

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:16.150
- This way, please.
- All right.

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:17.220
When is she coming out?

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:18.980
- Soon. Please wait.
- Sir, get in first.

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:19.860
She's coming out soon.

00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.860
Whatever good wine or dishes you have,

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:22.940
serve them.

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:23.780
All right.

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:28.660
Enjoy the food, sir.

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:31.420
Miss Su Nian is here.

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:33.820
Miss Su Nian, you've come at last.

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:35.700
Miss Su Nian has finally come.

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:40.540
We've been waiting for a long time.

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:11.060
(Su Nian, the unsurpassed lady
in the House of Romance)

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:22.820
Miss Su Nian dances even better than before.

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:24.940
She does?

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:26.980
I think she's ordinary.

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:28.820
In no case

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:31.060
can she dance better than the Persian girls

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:34.900
I've been keeping.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:39.220
Shiyu, I hear you keep
many beautiful ladies, too.

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:40.620
But you have no Persian girls,

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:42.140
do you?

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:44.700
In collecting beautiful girls,

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:46.580
I do far worse than you.

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:49.460
You're rather experienced, after all.

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.620
I'm no match for you.

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:55.740
I usually see the most beautiful ladies

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:57.020
and I'm too fed up

00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:59.540
to enjoy their charm.

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:01.380
Today, in this ordinary house,

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:03.020
I see some ordinary girls

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:04.260
and I find them a little bit attractive.

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:05.140
Just a little bit.

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:20.820
Bravo!

00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:22.700
Why does that girl

00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:26.380
look so familiar?

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:29.300
Impressive.

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:32.800
The real fairy.

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:38.780
Who's there?

00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:45.580
She's that vicious assassin!

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:47.340
Bravo!

00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:48.540
Don't be ridiculous.

00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:49.540
What assassin?

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:50.740
Come on, Yueling.

00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:52.580
She was the assassin in Dongyu.

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:53.660
I'm sure.

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:54.670
If you keep making trouble,

00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:55.650
I'll send you back.

00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:58.220
Fine, Yueling.

00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:59.060
Fill my cup.

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:03.060
(I will prove)

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.820
(you're that vicious assassin.)

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:10.220
(And you'll have to pay double)

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:11.540
(for how you humiliated me.)

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:14.060
How is everything going?

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:15.980
It's what the Prime Minister wants

00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:18.060
and I'll do the best I can.

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:23.020
Here. Have a look.

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:28.980
(Account Book)

00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:31.740
Well done.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:35.900
The North Prince's men didn't find it, huh?

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.140
Rest assured, Mr. Wang.

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:39.020
I've made a fake account book

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:39.860
as the substitute.

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:42.100
It looks totally real.

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:43.260
Good.

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:45.340
Come on, Mr. Wang. A toast to you.

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:46.660
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:48.820
(Since it's something to the North Prince,)

00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:50.940
(I'll have to get it.)
