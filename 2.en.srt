00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.130
How could you leave me to die?

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.810
I got you out of the water, didn't I?

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.060
You should have given me
mouth-to-mouth in the first place.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.900
Just now, I...

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.660
I thought you were resourceful enough

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.620
to save your own life.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:12.780
Where are you going?

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.130
To get some food.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.250
Hey, wait for me.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.660
I didn't expect you
to be so good at catching fish.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.060
And you roast it perfectly.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:38.780
Looks like

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.940
it's not that bad to have fallen

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:41.850
into the water with you.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.180
I can enjoy some roast fish.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.780
Are you saying it's bad
to fall into the water with me?

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.570
I... I don't mean that.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:53.410
Then what do you mean?

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.900
Never mind.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:56.460
Think about it.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.220
You and I survived together.

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.060
I deserve

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.220
some of your roast fish...

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.220
Don't I?

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.620
Ah?

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.530
Take some yourself.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:27.400
Or do you want me to feed you?

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.250
Oh.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:56.990
Maybe I have a look at your jade pendant?

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.220
Your pendant

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:01.850
looks really like mine.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.940
Indeed.

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.100
This is a whole piece.

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.170
Oh, they belong together.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.100
How did you get this pendant?

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.850
My mother gave it to me.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.490
Did she tell you anything about it?

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:38.730
What about yours?

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.220
I got my pendant

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.850
from a traveling necromancer.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.490
He said

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.660
it would get me into some adventures.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.020
Adventures?

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.290
So, we survived so many assassinations

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:55.530
because of this pendant?

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.140
I guess so.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.100
When the jade pendants are combined,

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.140
there will be adventures.

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.730
Is it that as long as we stay together,

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:09.660
we won't die?

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.140
We don't die now.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:12.820
But it doesn't mean we won't die.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.020
(The necromancer also said,)

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.850
(the combination of the pendants
will bring peace to this world.)

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:37.250
Chief,

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.140
the Princess of Dongyu has run away.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.460
We're searching for her separately.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.990
Members of the Dongyu escort
were almost dead or injured.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.190
(Nan Xun, assassin of the Roufeng Sect)
Some remnant guards escaped.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:46.460
Within one day,

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.460
you must find the Princess of Dongyu,

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:50.930
whether she's alive or dead.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:52.620
If you fail,

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.340
don't come back to me.

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:55.370
Aye.

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:08.930
(Wen Yu and I are safe with the pendants.)

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.780
(I wonder how Xingyi is doing.)

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.410
(Can his injury get worse?)

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:30.610
Still playing?

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.100
Wen Yu,

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:35.100
you must be thirsty, too.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.820
Here. Have some water.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:48.140
The water from the lake

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:49.220
tastes sweet.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:55.490
Sweet, indeed.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:59.970
Then drink some more.

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:01.820
Then we'll continue our journey.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:10.460
Why did you dump the leave?

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.490
You only had one sip?

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:13.700
I don't need this kind of water.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.050
What's so bad about it?

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:19.170
You just said it tasted sweet.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:23.020
Hey, wait for me.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.700
Dongyu people like you
are supposed to be strong, huh?

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:04.770
Why can't you walk

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.730
even as fast as the pet we keep?

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:09.650
Mr. Wen Yu,

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.540
I'm trying really hard to walk fast.

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:13.970
Based on your pace,

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.300
we won't be able to reach the Capital City

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.340
at the time agreed.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:19.130
But I can't walk anymore.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:20.540
I'm good at riding a horse

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.300
instead of walking.

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:28.220
How about

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:30.970
you carry me on your back?

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:34.130
I've never carried anyone before.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.130
And you're a female.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.130
Actually,

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:48.010
you're a nice guy.

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:50.370
You're my friend now.

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:51.370
There in Beishuo,

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:52.970
I'll be good to you.

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:55.650
You're used to your identity quickly.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:57.370
You talk like a princess now.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:01.890
Yes, indeed.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:06.580
In Beishuo,

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.250
if we still can't find the missing princess,

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:11.060
you'll have to be her.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:12.850
By then,

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.180
you'll be the real Eldest Princess of Dongyu.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:16.900
Hey.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.250
Are you asleep?

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:26.420
Chief,

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:27.700
we searched throughout the forest

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:29.540
but didn't find the missing princess.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.420
Maybe she escaped through another route.

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.730
We set so many traps,

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:37.850
but they still managed to run away.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:40.610
What on earth went wrong?

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:42.540
I failed my job, Chief.

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:43.850
I'm ready for the punishment.

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:49.420
Who's there?

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:54.700
Mercy, sir. Mercy.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.130
I'm just stopping by.

00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:59.850
Where is your princess?

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.340
What princess?

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.820
I'll confess.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:06.780
Tell us.

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:07.850
Where's the Eldest Princess?

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:10.610
I can take you to her.

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:12.970
But now I'm badly poisoned.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:14.540
I guess I'm dying.

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:16.460
I may be dead before we arrive.

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:18.060
How about...?

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.020
Say it.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.300
What do you want?

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.700
How about you detoxify me first?

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.420
Look, I'm so weak now.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:27.610
I can't make you carry me,

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:28.450
right?

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:29.850
Well, you can carry me.

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:30.690
But...

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:32.890
I may hold you up.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:34.220
So nagging.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:35.540
Give him the antidote.

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:37.330
Chief,

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:38.700
this is inappropriate.

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:40.250
How about you be the chief?

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:41.210
I don't dare.

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.260
March him

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:54.850
and let him lead the way.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:59.700
If you dare to fool me,

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.340
I'll make your life miserable.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:02.890
Will you ride a horse

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:04.610
while I run behind you?

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:05.450
No.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.300
So, you aren't that cruel.

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:21.940
I feel so weak now.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:24.060
I don't think I'm fully detoxified.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:30.020
Tell us where we should go.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:31.300
If you play a trick again,

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:32.650
I'll dump you.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:34.820
You vicious assassin.

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:36.970
Slow down.

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.340
Mercy, madam! Mercy!

00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:40.540
Where should we go?

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:42.420
To the north. To the south.

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:43.650
To... To the north.

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:44.490
Where exactly?

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:45.610
North.

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:46.610
North.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:49.180
Gentleman.

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:50.370
Thank you.

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:51.580
Without you,

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:52.730
we wouldn't know

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:54.010
how to get to the Capital City.

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:55.890
We're all from Dongyu.

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:58.010
I should help you.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:00.540
Gentleman.

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:02.940
You look happy all the way.

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:04.580
What pleases you?

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.100
I'm going to the Capital City
to get my daughter back to Dongyu.

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:08.820
I can't help feeling happy.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:10.660
That's great.

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:11.890
It's indeed something cheerful.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.370
It's so great to go back home.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:15.650
The Capital City

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:17.180
can't be as good as our state.

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:18.220
Yeah.

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.100
Dongyu is better without doubt.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.940
The war will be over.

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:23.850
My son was a soldier on the front line.

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:25.940
Now, he's also back home.

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:28.180
When we raise some cows and sheep,

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.540
we'll live a better life.

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:42.730
If I don't pretend to be the Eldest Princess,

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:44.650
what will happen?

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.060
The two states will cut ties

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:54.370
or even start a war.

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:58.540
So serious?

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:00.420
The marriage of the Eldest Princess

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.650
represents the sincerity
of the states' making peace.

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:05.250
It's about the covenant of the two states.

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:06.220
Once it's broken,

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:08.180
the war will be started again.

00:14:09.010 --> 00:14:10.850
By then, civilians will be homeless.

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:12.300
The world

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.460
will be plagued by war again.

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:16.580
Let me think about it.

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:19.610
I don't know where my brother is.

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:22.650
I have no idea how to decide.

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:25.100
His Highness's men will
escort Xingyi to the Capital City

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:27.650
and I'll find the antidote for you.

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:30.450
Are you sure?

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:33.100
What do I have to do?

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:34.660
All you have to do

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:37.370
is pretend to be the Eldest Princess.

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:50.980
What are you thinking about?

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:54.820
I think you're right.

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:12.970
I don't think you know where she is.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:14.580
Be gentle.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:19.490
How dare you fool us?

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:21.220
I'm going to kill you!

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:23.490
Sir, I... I...

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:24.610
Don't bother to waste time.

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:25.920
- Don't.
- Let's leave.

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:42.900
Here we are.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.540
Why does this man look so familiar?

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:48.730
His Highness sent him to pick us up.

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:50.100
He's good.

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:51.940
His Highness is always good.

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:55.940
- Greetings, Your Grace.
- Greetings, Your Grace.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:15:58.140
Xingyi.

00:15:58.540 --> 00:15:59.540
- Xingyi.
- Your Highness,

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:01.300
we lost Mr. Xingyi on the way.

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:02.580
Our men are still looking for him.

00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:04.330
Xingyi.

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:10.660
Where's my brother?

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:11.940
Don't worry, Your Grace.

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.250
Mr. Xingyi is on his way.

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:14.660
Someone will escort him to the Capital City.

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:15.970
He's so weak.

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:17.420
How could you leave him alone?

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.650
Your Grace, it's a long story.

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:21.210
I'll visit you and apologize another time.

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:22.490
You had a long trip.

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:24.730
How about you go back and get washed?

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:25.690
- Your Grace.
- But...

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:28.130
The gate is closing soon.

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:29.300
Get in the carriage.

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:33.260
Come, please.

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:46.020
(The Capital City of Beishuo)

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.530
Delicious and cheap.

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:53.680
Sugarcoated haws.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.800
This one looks nice.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.040
Toys for sale.

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:58.160
Pendants for sale.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:16:59.490
How does it taste?

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:00.340
Delicious.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.790
Pendants.

00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:07.450
The Capital City is so gorgeous.

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.880
Sugarcoated haws.

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:13.580
Beishuo

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:15.100
is more prosperous than Dongyu, huh?

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:16.930
Dongyu is better.

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:20.280
Sugarcoated haws.

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:23.100
Whose carriage is this?

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.260
Quite impressive.

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:28.980
It must be a rich family.

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:31.890
Chief, if we don't take action,
it will be too late.

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:33.140
Let's get back.

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:34.450
The mission failed.

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:43.380
Chief,

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:45.210
I'm sorry.

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:46.980
I'm just following the order.

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:02.580
Get started.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:23.740
(Mild Weather and Bright Scenery)
The princess has arrived.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.890
- Greetings, Your Grace.
- Greetings, Your Grace.

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:00.100
Now, you're the gentle
Eldest Princess of Dongyu.

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.370
Remember this.

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:03.340
Won't you get in with me?

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:04.740
I'm going for my mission report.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.340
Someone will come out and meet you.

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:16.850
(I should be gentle and elegant.)

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.650
(Now, I'm the Eldest Princess of Dongyu.)

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:26.170
I'm Eunuch Li.

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:27.850
Greeting, Your Grace.

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:35.980
You're arriving here today

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.580
and His Majesty cares about you.

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.890
But restrained by the rule,

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:41.370
a couple can't meet before the wedding.

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:43.610
So, His Majesty gave you a banquet

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:46.610
to show our goodwill for your state

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:48.340
and his care for you.

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:50.500
I appreciate it.

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:51.740
Thank you, Eunuch Li.

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:54.540
Oh, Your Grace, you flatter me.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.610
The Great Consort, the South Prince,
and the North Prince

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:58.100
also had some imperial dishes sent.

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:00.930
I won't stand in your way.

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.260
I'll take my leave.

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:06.980
Butler, walk him out.

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:07.900
Yes.

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:11.250
This way, please.

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:18.980
(Mild Weather and Bright Scenery)
Greetings, Your Grace. I'm Qiuju.

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:20.300
The Great Consort

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:21.850
offered shark fin soup,

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:22.930
pork rolls,

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:24.500
and lotus roots

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:26.020
to welcome you, Your Grace.

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:29.170
Greetings, Your Grace. I'm Rubing.

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:30.130
The North Prince

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:31.410
offered fried sparrows,

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:32.410
seafood balls,

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:33.250
and Maojian Tea

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.260
to welcome you, Your Grace.

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.450
Wish you a happy life in Beishuo.

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:40.130
Greetings, Your Grace. I'm Lizi.

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:42.930
Knowing about your arrival, the South Prince

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:45.740
had me deliver the most precious dishes.

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:47.000
Steamed bear's paws,

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:48.420
diced chicken meat with fleece-flower Root,

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:49.690
and sweet duck tongues.

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:51.930
Wish you good luck, longevity, and health.

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:05.130
Greetings, Brother.

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:06.650
You may rise, Shiyu.

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:16.660
(Zhou Chenyu, the Emperor of Beishuo)

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:17.530
Shiyu,

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:20.340
I heard you had a very dangerous trip.

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:22.450
As your eldest brother,

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.410
I should have protected you.

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.020
But this time,

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:27.930
you had to risk your life to Dongyu

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:28.850
for the peace negotiation.

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:32.540
I really feel sorry.

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:36.130
Unfortunately, due to my oversight,

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:37.980
the real princess is missing.

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:39.580
I feel so sorry, Brother.

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:44.650
It doesn't matter.

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:46.180
(Letter of Marriage Between Beishuo and Dongyu)

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:46.820
As long as this girl

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:48.980
can give us the power of Dongyu

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:50.820
and get us out of Uncle's impedance,

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:53.740
whether she's a princess or a maid

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:54.610
does not really matter.

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:58.130
You need to arrange more guards

00:21:58.170 --> 00:21:59.300
to keep the princess safe

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:01.580
in case something goes wrong

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:02.900
before the wedding.

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:04.100
I will.

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:05.980
The marriage

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:08.340
will end the war between Beishuo and Dongyu,

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:09.520
stabilize the political situation,

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:10.850
and secure the border for years.

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:13.780
I'll carefully protect the princess.

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:15.020
But Brother,

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:16.980
before Uncle returns from the suppression,

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.980
you should issue the marriage edict soon.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:20.450
In tomorrow's morning court,

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:23.410
I'll announce the marriage thing.

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:25.170
After the marriage,

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:28.890
hope the two states can always be peaceful.

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:32.780
It's also what I wish for.

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:37.060
She's such a vicious assassin.

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:39.300
What is the point

00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:40.340
of having a pretty face?

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:43.300
She kills people, anyway.

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:49.290
Oh, this.

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:50.740
I can use it.

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:56.450
She discarded me mercilessly.

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:58.020
So ruthless.

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:01.820
When I recover...

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:03.540
When I recover...

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:05.740
When I recover,

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.260
I'll show her

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:12.850
how strong I can be.

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:27.410
Just you wait,

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.820
vicious assassin.

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:32.740
(Mild Weather and Bright Scenery)

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:50.170
Is this the way

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:51.760
the Eldest Princess usually eats?

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:53.210
Wen Yu, you're back.

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:55.850
The food in your state

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:57.060
tastes really nice.

00:23:58.820 --> 00:23:59.890
Is that true?

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:00.890
Yes, of course.

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.650
A lot of people delivered the dishes.

00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:05.500
Each is more exquisite than the last.

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:07.100
And they are said to be

00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:08.290
the imperial dishes.

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:09.210
You've never tasted any, huh?

00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:14.210
Come on.

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:15.850
You have some, too. Enjoy it.

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:21.620
Thanks.

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:24.420
Tastes great.

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:42.740
Why do I feel I'm sleepy?

00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:44.300
You eat alone.

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:46.740
I'll go get some sleep.

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:53.540
Oh, no.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.100
The pastry is poisonous.

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:07.890
My Lord.

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:09.340
Wake up, My Lord.

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:11.780
Your Grace.

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:13.370
Wake up, Your Grace!

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:14.930
Your Grace.

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:16.410
What happened, Your Grace?

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:31.260
Fire.

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:32.300
Somebody come! Fire!

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.140
Hurry.

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:36.580
- Don't move.
- Why are you arresting me?

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:43.580
Your Grace.

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:51.050
You...

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:52.890
Seeing I'm not poisoned,

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:54.780
you must be disappointed, huh?

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:07.850
We're back to life again.

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:12.060
Can the pastry be poisonous?

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:13.340
Obviously.

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.260
Didn't they say

00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:19.890
they wanted to make nice
to the Princess of Dongyu?

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:21.130
Why did they try to kill me?

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:22.890
Just some claptraps.

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:24.850
But they looked really sincere.

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:35.620
Who exactly poisoned us?

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:38.500
The Emperor?

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:40.020
The Great Consort?

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:41.700
The South Prince.

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:43.340
The North Prince.

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:45.300
The guards or the chefs?

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:46.180
The eunuch.

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:47.820
Everyone is suspicious.

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.580
You people are vicious.

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:55.900
If our princess really came,

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:57.420
she would be dead many times.

00:26:58.060 --> 00:26:58.900
Oh, no.

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:01.220
She couldn't even make it to the Capital City.

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:02.700
Mind your tongue.

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:06.100
I can't even complain?

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:13.740
Can I stop

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:15.580
pretending to be the Eldest Princess?

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:18.260
You can't.

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:22.660
It's not time to shrink back.

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:24.620
And don't you want to know

00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:26.300
who poisoned you?

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:28.740
Right.

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:30.740
We must catch this bad guy.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:32.540
The poisoner

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:34.500
must be on the same team

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:35.700
with the assassins on our way back.

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.780
I guess they'll ambush us tonight.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:43.060
They followed us to the Capital City.

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:45.820
This guy must be very powerful.

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:48.060
He poisoned the pastry to kill you

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:51.460
even on the first day you settled down.

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:53.140
The one behind this

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.180
doesn't seem to be intelligent.

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:57.860
It's a poor trick, indeed.

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:00.340
Poison in the pastry.

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.660
This guy must be still here.

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:06.500
In this case,

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:07.860
we can

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.500
draw him out.

00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:15.260
Confess.

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:17.140
Who sent you to kill me?

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:19.180
I don't know.

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:22.300
I don't know

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:23.620
why the food is poisonous.

00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:25.980
Are you sure?

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.380
Why did you slander me

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:30.100
for poisoning you?

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:30.940
So

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:33.740
the Eldest Princess and I
caught the wrong poisoner

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:35.020
and wrongly accused you?

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:38.140
I...

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:41.420
I didn't know about the poison thing.

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:43.620
Leave her to me.

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.300
I put some toxins in the ink

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:56.420
that can corrode your skin.

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:58.060
By then,

00:28:58.860 --> 00:28:59.820
your face

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:01.380
will be disfigured.

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:04.180
I don't know anything.

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:06.740
I really don't know anything.

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:12.620
(Mild Weather and Bright Scenery)

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:16.380
Oh, no.

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:18.220
Your face is ruined.

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:20.500
You just kill me.

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:22.380
I won't confess anything!

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:25.700
You aren't even scared of disfigurements.

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:27.900
I'll try the second trick, then.

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:37.980
Oh, no. I can't stand it.

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:39.460
I'll confess.

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:42.220
Who's behind all this?

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:44.580
The North Prince.

00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:47.180
The North Prince?

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:48.940
Your Grace,

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:51.300
the North Prince sent me.

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:53.540
You can't distinguish the princes, huh?

00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:57.900
You work for the South Prince.

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:00.900
No, it's not him.

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:07.580
Mercy, Your Grace. Mercy!

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:08.940
Spare me, Your Grace!

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:09.780
Wait.

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:11.380
Show some mercy, Your Grace.

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:13.220
We should let

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:14.640
the South Prince have his dignity.

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:16.750
I'll have her sent back there.

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:18.220
I don't.

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:19.620
I don't work for the South Prince.

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:20.740
Fine.

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:22.300
After the whole day,

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:23.460
I'm quite tired.

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:26.140
Is the South Prince really as useless

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:27.020
as he's said to be?

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:30.060
Don't humiliate His Highness.

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:33.100
He's the wisest man in this world.

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:34.900
You're loyal.

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:36.780
Have her sent back.

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:46.340
I sent you to take care of the princess.

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:48.100
How come you end up like this?

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:49.780
And you're even sent back.

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:52.100
Aren't you slapping His...?

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:53.220
Oh, sorry.

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.020
Can't you see Piggy is sleeping?

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:57.180
(Zhou Zhixuan, the South Prince of Beishuo)
Don't make me punish you.

00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:59.630
(Yang Xu, the South Prince's butler)
Aren't you slapping His Highness in the face?

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:00.500
Butler Yang,

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:03.060
I did what His Highness asked me to do.

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:05.660
But they seemed to be alerted.

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:08.420
I nearly poisoned the Princess of Dongyu.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.140
Come on, you...

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:11.420
Poison?

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:13.500
Who did you try to poison?

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:14.660
The...

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:17.460
The Princess of Dongyu.

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:19.900
Are you insane?

00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:21.340
You want to screw me, huh?

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:23.580
Or do you think it's so easy for me

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:24.860
to be the South Prince?

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:26.580
But...

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.940
You ordered me to do that.

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:31.420
I did?

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:33.780
When did I do that?

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:36.140
Yang Xu.

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:37.980
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Did I order her?

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:41.460
Yes, you did.

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:43.300
- Right?
- Did I order her?

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:44.580
- Yeah. Yes.
- Right?

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:46.420
- You did.
- Yeah, you did.

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:51.940
Did I?

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:56.420
Come over.

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:57.500
Come.

00:31:58.140 --> 00:31:59.020
Come over here.

00:31:59.020 --> 00:31:59.860
Your Highness.

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:02.060
It's so lovely.

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:04.900
Don't run, Piggy.

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:07.820
This is maid Taozi
who will be sent to the Princess of Dongyu.

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:10.100
Her little brother was badly sick

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:12.900
and couldn't be cured
without your award, Your Highness.

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:14.180
So, she swore

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:15.780
to be your slave.

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:18.940
That's not necessary.

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:20.300
I'm just too kind

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:21.380
to see this misery.

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:24.420
Taozi, huh?

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.300
Who gave you this name?

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:29.180
So tacky.

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:31.420
Look at them.

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:32.660
Chunhua.

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:34.540
Qiuyue.

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:36.100
Xiachan.

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:37.620
Dongxue.

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:39.540
Piggy.

00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:41.580
Such romantic names.

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:42.580
Awesome.

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:43.620
Your Highness, don't you remember?

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:45.500
You named her Taozi.

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:49.180
You favored fruit at that time.

00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:51.780
So maids of that period were named

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:53.180
Taozi, Leezi, Lezi, Lizi...

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:54.020
Go away.

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:56.100
Such terrible names!

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:57.280
You must have come up with them.

00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:58.300
Tacky.

00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:00.540
Yeah, I came up with them.

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:02.220
It's always wise of you, Your Highness.

00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:04.460
Do you know what you're supposed to do there?

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:06.660
According to Butler Yang,

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:08.700
I should take care of the Prince of Dongyu

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:10.620
and get information for you.

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:12.540
These aren't the most important.

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:14.100
The most important thing is

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:16.060
the North Prince got her back.

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:18.220
Then she's on his side, right?

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:21.780
She's the opposite of me, huh?

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:25.580
So, I must give her a hard time!

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:28.100
Yes.

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:29.660
Darn it, the North Prince.

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:32.220
He took all the credit.

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:34.220
I should have gone there.

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:37.300
Your Highness, I heard the North Prince

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:38.580
nearly died on his way back.

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:40.260
So did the Princess of Dongyu.

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:41.100
Stop running.

00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:42.220
Nearly died?

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:45.100
If only Zhou Shiyu died!

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:48.780
Then he wouldn't dare to stand against me.

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:51.540
Sadly, he's lucky enough to live.

00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:53.020
He's coming to town soon.

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:56.140
Darn it.

00:33:57.540 --> 00:33:58.740
The terrible Princess of Dongyu.

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:00.780
I wish they would both die!

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:04.860
I get it, Your Highness.

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:06.460
I won't let you down.

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:08.940
Idiot. You piss me off.

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:11.060
It's all my fault.

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:13.300
I just tried to help you, Your Highness.

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:14.780
Tried to help me?

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:15.740
Help me?

00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:16.940
Then why didn't you kill her?

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:18.020
I nearly...

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:20.700
That was close.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:23.220
She just nearly...

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:24.820
Wait, wait.

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:26.140
If you had killed her,

00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:27.420
I would be screwed, too.

00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:31.900
Look at you.

00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:33.420
Oh, that is infuriating.

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:34.700
Leave us.

00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:35.900
Don't stay to annoy His Highness.

00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:38.820
I'll... I'll take my leave.

00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:46.060
Your Highness,

00:34:46.740 --> 00:34:49.340
the North Prince's men sent Taozi back.

00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:51.220
He had a letter for you, too.

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:54.220
(The North Prince's Mansion)

00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:57.420
I'll let you go this time.

00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:58.980
Hope you'll behave yourself.

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:03.100
Zhou Shiyu!

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:05.980
Your Highness.

00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:07.900
- Calm down, Your Highness.
- Don't be angry, Your Highness.

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:11.140
I ride faster than you.

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:12.180
Can you catch up?

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:13.340
Your Highness, cool down.

00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:19.580
I thought after I survived the assassination

00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:20.660
and reached Beishuo,

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.020
I could be relieved.

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.340
But today, I was nearly poisoned.

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:25.940
I just don't understand.

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:26.820
Are Beishuo people

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:29.180
so eager to kill our Eldest Princess?

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:31.100
The Eldest Princess is powerful

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:33.500
and her marriage represents
the peace of the world.

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:35.820
Those who want peace are supportive.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:38.580
But still a lot of people want to stir the pot.

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:42.460
We don't know who is behind the assassination.

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:44.580
Now, the South Prince is a trouble, too.

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:47.460
It really gives me a headache.

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:52.140
Don't worry about the South Prince.

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:53.420
He isn't smart enough.

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:55.820
Indeed.

00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:57.620
Just as the rumor goes,

00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:59.780
there are great talents in your state.

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:01.580
The useless North Prince

00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:02.780
and the worthless South Prince.

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:05.220
Rather impressive.

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:08.100
You flatter us, Your Grace.

00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:10.660
I don't mean that.

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:13.100
Now, you and I

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:14.900
are both in this together.

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:16.220
And you're a native.

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:17.500
In the future,

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:19.140
you'll have to help me.

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:20.980
We both have the pendants

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:22.820
and we'll risk our lives together.

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:24.060
Besides,

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:26.140
I've been taking you as one of us.

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:29.860
And you are

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:32.660
so righteous, kind, and brave.

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:33.500
Just tell me.

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:34.340
What do you want?

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:52.660
Wen Yu,

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:54.580
it's not that I'm scared.

00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:56.540
But I have to pretend
to be the Eldest Princess.

00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:57.820
I can't die.

00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:00.740
So, you might as well

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:03.020
stay in the room and protect me.

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:04.420
It's good for both you and me.

00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:09.900
How... How can I sleep like this?

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:11.140
Umm...

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:13.860
I'll loosen it.

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:15.940
Then you can sleep on the ground.

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:17.940
On the ground?
