All you need to do is take orders.

The Prime Minister won't mistreat you.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.580
Mr. Wang, I'll count on you.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.100
No problem.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.980
This girl looks pretty.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.260
But she dances poorly.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.700
Cheers, Mr. Zhang.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:22.620
Cheers.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.020
Pretty, does it hurt?

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.260
I'm fine.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.260
Look.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.260
Even such a terrible dancer

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.980
can work in the House of Romance.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.860
Sorry, officials.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.580
It's the first I've danced here for a living

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.180
and seen bigwigs like you.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.660
I can't help feeling nervous.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.620
I'll go get some better girls here.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.340
- All right.
- Go ahead.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.300
Come on, Mr. Wang.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.100
Mr. Wang, another toast to you.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.510
- Cheers.
- Stop.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.360
Cheers.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.820
You seductive fox!

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.740
How dare you play innocent in front of me?

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.580
My husband keeps coming here lately.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.380
You must have seduced him.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.540
Or why would he come here every day?

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.420
Umm... Madam, do you get the wrong girl?

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.980
It's my first day here.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.900
I really don't know your husband.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.700
He has a lover here for a long time.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.540
I know that.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.780
Or why would he always not go home?

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.540
A seductive girl like you

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.180
must be the reason he keeps coming.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.220
Confess. Is it you?

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.260
It's really not me.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.660
Is it you? Confess.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:37.700
No!

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.340
Wen Yu?

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.900
Madam, I really don't know your husband.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.660
This is actually my lover.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:00.900
What are you doing here?

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.300
Why didn't you tell me before you came?

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.420
You look handsome

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.860
but have a bad taste.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.420
If this seductive girl is yours,

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.940
restrain her.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:12.940
Don't let her out so casually

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.220
to seduce someone else's husband.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.860
What are you talking about?

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.940
Mind your tongue.
You must be getting the wrong girl.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.420
She and I love each other.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.140
How would she seduce anyone else?

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.180
So indecent.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.060
What? No more acting?

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.100
Forget it.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.220
Why do you stare at me like this?

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.780
Look what you're wearing.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.060
No wonder she got you wrong.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.020
What's wrong with my dress?

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.300
And look at you.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.260
When you're dressed like this,

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.300
strangers

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.780
will think you're a prince.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.940
I am...

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.260
Isn't that...?

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.100
What are you doing here?

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.740
I wanted to ask you.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.620
You people have pushed too far.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:11.500
Your emperor made me marry

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.100
the useless North Prince.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.460
I'm out for a walk. What's the problem?

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.900
The North Prince isn't
as terrible as you think he is.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.220
I don't care.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.660
I may not really

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:20.720
be the North Princess Consort.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.860
Are you going

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.620
to run away?

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.140
- I...
- Mr. Chen,

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:33.940
what are you doing here?

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:35.820
Baihe.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.140
Baihe, don't go.

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.540
Baihe, I really missed you.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:41.780
So, I came to see you.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.340
Mr. Chen, you lied to me.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.040
How do you have the nerve to see me again?

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.850
I'm a businessman.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.660
I shouldn't have lied that I was an official.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.100
- Oh, man.
- Baihe, let me explain.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.000
He made up an identity to cheat this girl.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.540
- What a dirty trick!
- I don't want to listen.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:59.500
I just don't.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.180
Baihe.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.700
- He made up an identity.
- I'm really wrong.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.800
- Maybe he has a reason for that.
- I'm sorry.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.980
- Don't ignore me.
- What reason can he have?

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:08.940
You're a musician.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.420
I know you always want to marry an official.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.980
Indeed, I'm a musician.

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.540
Marrying an official will change my identity.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.140
But the love between us

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.780
can't be as important as such identities?

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.220
It's my fault.

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.140
I underestimated your feelings for me.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:27.780
Forgive me this once.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.580
I won't lie to you again.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:31.580
Musician?

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:32.960
- What is a musician?
- Really?

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:33.830
Yes.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.420
- Why does a musician want to marry an official?
- If you lie to me again,

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.780
- In Beishuo, a musician is humble.
- I won't see you anymore.

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.420
- If a musician wants another identity,
- I won't.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:43.340
she has to marry an official.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:47.940
This is such a terrible rule.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.580
I'll come and see you in a couple of days.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:08.700
All right.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.300
But you should

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.740
tell your father about our marriage soon.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:13.740
Rest assured.

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.100
I won't betray you.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:26.660
We

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:28.100
can go out.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.020
I...

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.140
I...

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:33.380
I can't feel my legs.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:01.300
Thank you.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:06.900
Wait for me.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.100
What a man!

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.140
Some girls can't get married

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.260
when they want to

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.460
while some have to get married

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:17.540
when they don't want it.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:19.940
Everyone has his destiny.

00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.940
Let's say farewell.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:26.620
See you again.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:29.660
Ordinary people may choose
who they want to marry.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.180
But if His Majesty knows

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:33.620
the Eldest Princess of Dongyu
will escape against his decree,

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.420
the consequences will be terrible, huh?

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:39.940
I guess the troops will be sent to your state.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.540
They'll search throughout Dongyu.

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:45.180
By then, who knows how many

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.220
Eldest Princesses will be found?

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.620
(So serious?)

00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:54.740
Oh, we should do some shopping

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:55.900
for our mansion.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:57.820
From now on,

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.540
we'll live there for a long time.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.100
We need to be well prepared.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.340
You're familiar with this place. Take us there.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.900
Why did you come to the House of Romance?

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.380
I came with His Highness.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.620
Your future husband.

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:19.980
The North Prince? He's also here?

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:20.980
Where's he?

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:22.260
I'll go say hello.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:25.380
A couple can't see each other
before getting married.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.260
It's the rule.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:30.860
Such a boring rule.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.860
Forget it. I'm going back.

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:40.430
Bravo!

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:45.580
You were away for quite a while.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.500
Did any pretty girl hold you up?

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:52.900
Nothing you need trouble yourself about.

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.220
Well, I think.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.980
If you fall in love with any girl,

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:01.220
let me know.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:02.980
I'll help you get her.

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:10.060
If you don't want me to interfere,

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.060
I won't trouble myself, then.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.900
Come on. Let's drink.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.020
Gentlemen, thank you for coming.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:32.980
Miss Su Nian, the unsurpassed lady,

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.860
will drink with you.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:36.900
Thank you, Miss Su Nian.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.020
Madam Sang,

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:52.820
when will Miss Su Nian

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:53.740
dance again?

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.820
As long as you visit us frequently,

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.100
she'll often dance before you.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.140
Xingyi,

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.220
what are you doing?

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:02.980
Why are you glaring at her
as if she was an enemy?

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:04.420
She's an enemy.

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.500
Yueling, I've been staring at her for a while.

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:07.780
I'm sure

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:09.500
she's the vicious assassin

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.420
who discarded me twice.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:12.820
Assassin?

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.820
Greetings.

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:26.540
I've never seen you before.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:28.900
Is it your first visit here?

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:29.900
Yes.

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.100
Never seen us before?

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.660
But you're exactly that assassin.

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:34.420
Assassin?

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:35.460
How could Miss Su be an assassin?

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:37.180
You get the wrong girl, I guess.

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:40.860
I'm a mere dancer in the House of Romance.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.820
That day, you carried me
on the horse for a long time.

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:44.220
I can recognize you, however you change look.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.500
I really don't know what you're talking about.

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.460
Yeah, gentleman.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.420
Do you get the wrong girl?

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.380
Miss Su Nian has never left here.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.260
Sorry, Miss Su.

00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:58.540
My brother

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.180
always has face blindness.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:01.820
I guess he's having the problem again.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.500
If he offends you, please kindly forgive him.

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:06.300
Not at all.

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.180
Maybe I just have

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:10.180
a very ordinary face.

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.020
It's normal that he can't recognize me.

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:14.420
Hey, you...

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:18.820
Sorry.

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:22.300
A toast to you, dear guests.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:25.620
Hope you'll often come here.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:36.260
It's her.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:37.660
Yueling, it's her.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.660
How can a girl have two faces?

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.100
She's so good at concealing her identity.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.180
No wonder she's the unsurpassed lady.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:45.540
Xingyi, I think Miss Su

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.180
looks gentle and behaves elegantly.

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:50.220
She isn't like an assassin at all.

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:52.380
Yueling, you don't trust me?

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:54.580
I do. Let's get back.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:55.420
I won't.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.020
I'll see

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.180
when she'll give herself away.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.980
Sorry to keep you waiting, Your Highnesses.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:07.780
Knowing the two princes have come,

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:09.220
Miss Su Nian is here to propose a toast.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.140
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:14.740
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:17.020
You may rise.

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.340
Miss Su Nian, tonight,

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:22.780
you look gorgeous.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:27.100
You dance even better than before.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.180
You flatter me, Your Highness.

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:32.060
Let me propose a toast to you.

00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:54.180
Indeed.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.140
It's better to watch a pretty girl close.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.300
(Why did I lose my grip at this time?)

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:10.540
(I'm really...)

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:12.780
Shall we rush up or not?

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:15.260
He said he would crack a cup to remind us.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:18.100
Go.

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:27.140
Su Nian, run!

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:29.940
Go. Hurry.

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:31.060
Look, Yueling.

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.460
The assassin will finally give herself away.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:39.340
Come on, Xingyi.

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:40.580
Let's go help Miss Su.

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:41.420
Don't.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:42.700
I'm sure she can do martial arts.

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.540
You don't still think
she's an assassin, do you?

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:45.740
Yueling, just watch.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.740
She'll easily kill these guys soon.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.060
Why is she coming over?

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.620
Please help me.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.620
Don't worry, Miss Su. We both do martial arts

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:55.700
and we can protect you.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.220
Thank you.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:58.540
Can't you do martial arts, too?

00:14:58.540 --> 00:14:59.780
Why do you need us?

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:01.580
Don't be so rude to a lady.

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:05.940
You keep her safe.

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:06.780
I'll be right back.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:09.580
Don't move.

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:16.300
Isn't he the cowardly man I met in the day?

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:17.860
Why is he here?

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:18.780
Don't... Don't come over.

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:19.980
Don't do silly things.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:21.060
What?

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.860
The South Prince has really good martial arts.

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.060
You're that assassin.

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:42.820
Don't go.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:45.820
Why are you still here?

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.230
These assassins after this cowardly man...

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:52.070
You don't come over.

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.580
- Who are they?
- What?

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:55.540
Stay away.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:58.900
He can't be the North Prince, can he?

00:15:58.900 --> 00:15:59.740
Stay behind me.

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:01.940
He's the South Prince.

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.580
- You know each other?
- Don't come over. Just don't.

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:05.740
Not really.

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.020
He tried to save me.

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:07.980
- But his plan failed.
- Don't run.

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.580
(You just need to pretend to kill me.)

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:15.860
(But you idiots)

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:17.020
(keep coming after me.)

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:23.620
Come on.

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:27.500
Protect the North Prince.

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:30.220
That's right. Protect the North Prince.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:31.100
Protect the North Prince.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:31.940
Run!

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:33.300
Too late.

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:46.420
Again?

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:48.460
You're such an idiot.

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:15.900
Protect the South Prince!

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.100
(This isn't)

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:29.500
(what I planned.)

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:34.260
(Wen Yu, I'll save you.)

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:46.500
One.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:48.460
Two.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.620
Yueling, what are you doing?

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:52.460
Go with me.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:02.620
(Mild Weather and Bright Scenery)

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:06.420
Your Highness, Your Grace,

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:07.460
you're back.

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:08.660
I packed something else.

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:09.700
When are we leaving?

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.060
That vicious woman

00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:12.340
has so many tricks.

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:14.220
She's sometimes gentle and sometimes evil.

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:15.700
Oh, no.

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:18.220
Is Wen Yu dead?

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:23.820
What happened?

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.540
Why do you look so dazed

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.300
after you're back?

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:28.660
Oh, no.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:29.780
It must be her.

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.580
I didn't die with him.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.700
What are you talking about?

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:39.020
Why can I not get it?

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:41.420
So, are we escaping or not?

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:42.900
- No.
- No.

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.300
No?

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:47.420
Wen Yu, who escorted me here...

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:49.580
He died.

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.540
How did that happen?

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:57.300
He's young. That's too bad.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:00.460
But what does it have to do

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.020
with our escape?

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:04.620
You don't understand.

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:06.780
He needn't have died.

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:09.180
If I had died with him,

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.580
we would be back to life.

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:16.740
Your Grace, the dead can't come back to life.

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.500
How can he live again?

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:19.340
That's not right.

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:21.700
Nobody else can. But he can.

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:23.140
Not alone.

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:24.900
We can come back to life together.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:27.740
Forget it.

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:29.460
I'm going to the North Prince's mansion.

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.000
Your Grace, it's late at night.

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:32.620
It's really inappropriate
to see a martial guard

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:34.260
in the North Prince's mansion now.

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.940
If you really want to see him,

00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:38.140
how about you go tomorrow?

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:39.740
You can send an invitation,

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.540
offering to visit the North Prince

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:43.460
as his bride-to-be.

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:47.220
But a couple can't see each other

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:48.300
before getting married.

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:50.740
What if the North Prince doesn't approve?

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:52.660
Yueling,

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:54.300
why would Dongyu people like us

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:55.540
obey Beishuo rules?

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.180
You're right.

00:19:58.620 --> 00:19:59.620
My top priority

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:01.220
is to check on Wen Yu.

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:02.300
I can't bother about anything else.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:04.220
I'll go prepare the invitation, then.

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:09.620
Hope Wen Yu will be all right.

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:11.820
Your Highness!

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.260
Your Highness!

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:18.300
I failed my job to keep you safe.

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.900
I should be punished, Your Highness.

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:22.620
Your Highness.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.860
I'm not dead yet.

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:30.420
Forget it. It wasn't your fault.

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:33.540
Oh, Your Highness,

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.620
a message was sent from Dongyu.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.580
I haven't told you yet.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:38.980
Tell me now.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:40.500
According to our scout,

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:41.860
in Dongyu,

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:43.580
besides the Eldest Princess,

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:44.860
there is another princess.

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.540
And her name is Yueling.

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.580
Ashina Yueling.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:51.020
This young princess is said

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.660
to be always liberal.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:55.180
Now, she isn't in the imperial palace.

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:56.020
Oh, Your Highness.

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:57.620
Even more coincidentally,

00:20:57.620 --> 00:20:59.780
she has a little brother,

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:01.020
Xingyi.

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:02.940
The young prince of Dongyu.

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:07.420
Yueling for Ashina Yueling.

00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:10.220
Xingyi for Ashina Xingyi.

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:13.620
Oh, I see.

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:17.460
Such a dramatic trick.

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:21.140
So, she and her brother fooled us.

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:23.180
No wonder

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:25.100
they helped the Eldest Princess escape.

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:28.220
Have our men watch over Dongyu.

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:29.100
Remember.

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:32.220
Don't let anyone else know about this.

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:34.020
So, you'll marry the young princess

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:36.340
instead of the Eldest Princess

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:37.860
and you'll just let it go?

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.580
In the marriage,

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.140
the bride doesn't really matter.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:44.420
I must focus on the big picture.

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:53.100
Your Highness.

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:59.060
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:02.580
Your Highness, are you injured?

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:04.340
You can't die, Your Highness.

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:09.260
Injured?

00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:11.340
That's what you've been expecting, huh?

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:14.620
If only I was injured!

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:17.060
Then I could frame Zhou Shiyu

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.260
for murdering his elder brother.

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:20.660
But what happened?

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:22.900
He was stabbed to protect me.

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:25.340
Even His Majesty has heard about it.

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:27.140
Now, he's meritorious!

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:28.660
What do you actually want,

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:30.900
to be injured or not to be injured?

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:32.860
Of course, I want...

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:35.460
Forget it. Doesn't matter.

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:38.060
What matters is your terrible self-injury trick

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:39.580
didn't work at all!

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:41.300
Such an idiot.

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:42.900
Indeed.

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:48.580
That's right. I'm too incapable.

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:49.460
I can't even be

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:51.900
as smart as Piggy.

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.260
Or it'll be humiliating the pig.

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:00.620
You even want to roast my pig?

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:02.260
No, no, no. That's not what I mean.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:03.460
I don't mean that, Your Highness.

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:04.740
Hurry.

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:09.420
Punish him now!

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.260
- Yes.
- No, Your Highness.

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.500
I really don't mean that.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:13.340
Piggy.

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:14.700
Your Highness, you get me wrong.

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:17.620
I hate those who love to eat roast pork.

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:19.060
- Your Highness.
- Don't be scared.

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:21.300
Tickle him as hard as you can.

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:22.780
- All right.
- Your Highness.

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:24.140
Don't be scared, Piggy.

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:52.780
You did a good job.

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:56.380
The aggravated contradictions
between the two princes

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:58.420
will drive a feud between them

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:01.220
and impede the young emperor.

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:08.140
It's my duty to help you, Prime Minister.

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:18.980
(The North Prince's Mansion)

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:25.620
It's my honor to be married
to the North Prince by His Majesty.

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:27.940
I hear the North Prince is handsome

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:29.340
and righteous.

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.780
Everybody likes him.

00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:33.420
I want to see him

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:36.500
for my affection and admiration.

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:37.860
So, I'd like to visit His Highness.

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:39.980
Sorry for the inconvenience.

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.740
Her writing skills are really...

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:45.740
Naughty.

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:50.860
Are you sure she's Ashina Yueling,

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:52.180
the young princess of Dongyu?

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:53.030
Yes.

00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:54.460
I double-checked it.

00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:57.860
Your Highness,

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:00.100
will you meet

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:02.380
this princess?

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.860
According to the rule,

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:06.180
a couple can't see each other
before getting married.

00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:09.460
She won't give up before seeing me.

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.940
Then I can see her

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:14.260
while she can't see me.

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:19.300
I get it. I'm on it.

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:24.420
This way, please.

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:30.780
Is there a Mr. Wen Yu

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:33.140
working for His Highness?

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:35.020
Is he here today?

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:36.300
Wen Yu?

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:38.420
It's me, exactly.

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:40.540
It sounds similar to His Highness's name.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:41.900
But His Highness said it was all right.

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.420
You're Wen Yu?

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:46.220
But the man I know

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:48.180
is a young martial guard.

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:50.700
Someone has the same name?

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:53.140
Well, a lot of talents

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:54.660
work for His Highness.

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:56.980
I can't recognize them all.

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:01.060
The yards here

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:02.620
look really pretty.

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:04.180
Yes, of course.

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:06.500
His Highness is the lineal son
of the late emperor

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.260
and the youngest brother of His Majesty.

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:10.660
He can own all the best things in the world.

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:11.660
Come this way, please.

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:15.140
Be careful.

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:17.100
Here.

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:18.300
I'm here.

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:22.100
Over here.

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:24.180
Come.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:25.140
You can't catch me.

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:27.860
Be careful.

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:30.980
Where are you?

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:33.740
House of Pretties?

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:36.100
Who is this house for?

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:38.420
You have sharp eyes, Miss.

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:39.820
Ladies in this house

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.540
(House of Pretties)
are all gorgeous.

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:43.820
They are sent from different places.

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.140
According to His Highness,

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:46.380
he won't marry these ladies

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:49.060
until he has a consort.

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:51.940
Respect to his future wife, you know.

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:53.700
(This prince)

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:56.660
(has built a house of ladies a long time ago)

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:59.140
(and thinks he's respecting his future wife.)

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:01.100
(How shameless!)

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:02.780
This way, please.

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:05.620
(House of Pretties)

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:08.780
(Stay Modest)

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:11.540
Your Highness, the Eldest Princess
of Dongyu is here.

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.580
I hear you adore me.

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.820
A couple in Beishuo can't see each other
before getting married.

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:36.820
Did no one tell you about it?

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:41.380
Is that why you see me
from behind the curtain?

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:42.900
When you break the rule,

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:45.780
I'll be the one people laugh at.

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.140
Your Grace,

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:49.420
I'm sure you can understand,

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:51.380
can't you?

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:55.700
You have your rules

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:58.140
while we have ours.

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:00.060
A couple can't see each other here.

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.220
But that's not the case in our state.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:05.100
If it's inappropriate, please understand.

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:10.380
Unlike what you're said to be like,

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:12.500
you have such a quick tongue.

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:15.580
I'm too busy with work

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:18.020
to care about you, Your Grace.

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:20.100
If you need anything,

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:23.060
have someone inform my butler.

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.620
I want someone from you, Your Highness.

00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:28.180
You'll approve, huh?

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:29.700
Who do you want?

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:31.740
Wen Yu.

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:35.940
Not the butler,

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:37.300
but the martial guard.

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:42.740
Why do you want him?

00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:59.260
My maid Yueling

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:02.380
received a lot of help
from Wen Yu on her way here.

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:04.540
So, she adores him.

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:07.780
Yesterday, she accidentally heard

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:09.700
Wen Yu was assassinated
in the House of Romance

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:10.980
and she was really worried.

00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:12.860
So, she begged me to come and ask about him.

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:17.180
Your Highness, do you know how Wen Yu is now?

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:19.900
You sound so anxious.

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:23.420
I think you actually adore him

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:25.820
instead of Miss Yueling.

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:28.940
Yueling adores him.

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:31.260
I'm just anxious for her.

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:34.060
Tell Miss Yueling

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:34.940
to forget Wen Yu.

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:36.940
Why?

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:39.980
Because he's dead.

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:47.900
Be careful, Your Grace.

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:07.140
Qianqian,

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:12.580
Wen Yu is dead.

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:17.580
Your Grace, the dead can't come back to life.

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:19.740
Don't hurt yourself.

00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:21.900
I got him killed.

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:24.460
That's not true.

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:28.540
Go buy me a brazier.

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:31.540
I'm on it.

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:48.900
What maid?

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:53.380
It's just you.

00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:56.740
Your Highness,

00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:58.860
what did you just say to Her Grace?

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:00.940
She looked absent-minded

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:01.990
and couldn't even walk steadily.

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:04.820
I feared she would bump into a pillar.

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:09.420
Nothing.

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:22.420
I don't know what I should burn for you.

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:24.380
Here's some paper money.

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:26.180
Enjoy it.

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:28.620
And these pretty women of all kinds.

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:32.740
Pick one as your wife.

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:37.660
You didn't

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:39.420
leave your jade pendant to me.

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:41.140
I'll then burn

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:43.140
my pendant for you.

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:46.420
If you get into trouble in heaven,

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.340
it may help you.

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:54.660
Do you not want to lose the pendant

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:57.740
or do you not want to lose me?

00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:14.380
Wen Yu,

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:16.980
if... if you hate this,

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:19.220
go find those men who killed you.

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:21.060
Whatever you want,

00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:22.020
I'll burn it for you.

00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:23.540
I'll burn... I'll burn some paper money.

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:25.700
Or anything. Anything you want.

00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:27.460
And these pretty women...

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:28.460
Pick one.

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:30.020
I'll burn anyone you want.

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:32.420
These women are boring.

00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:34.780
I want you!
