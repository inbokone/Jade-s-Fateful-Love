Su Nian,

20
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:54,840
so,

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,730
you let go of that man last time

22
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,400
and now you can make use of him.

23
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,730
Actually, I'm not sure if he'll come.

24
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,330
As a lady, gorgeous, smart,

25
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:09,960
mysterious, and stylish,

26
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,360
you're irresistible to all men in this world.

27
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,130
It's so sweet of you.

(Benign and Benevolent)

29
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,760
Greetings, Your Highness.

30
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,520
A lady outside our mansion

31
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,920
asked me to give Mr. Xingyi this invitation.

32
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,900
(Invitation)

33
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,330
Lady?

34
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,680
Lady?

35
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,170
Who is that lady?

36
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,920
"Gentleman, I adored you as I met you.

37
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,290
After you left, I asked around

38
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,920
and finally got to know
you worked for the princess.

39
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,960
I hereby invite you

40
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,050
to a chat in the House of Romance."

41
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,890
Adore?

42
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,800
She adores me?

43
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,520
Why do I feel scared?

44
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,360
Maybe that is only

45
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,960
her pleasantry.

46
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,570
She just wants to talk, I guess.

47
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:14,850
Oh,

48
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,130
have you found the evidence
for her being an assassin?

49
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:20,570
No, actually.

50
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,480
So,

51
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,130
stop slandering Miss Su.

52
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,080
This is weird.

53
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,450
I'd like to see what she's up to.

54
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,890
You're going again?

55
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,170
Don't make trouble!

56
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,130
I'll go with you.

57
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,330
Wait for me.

58
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,290
Hey, Your Grace.

59
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,320
Your Highness,

60
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,480
Her Highness went out again.

61
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,730
Are our dark guards following her?

62
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,330
Nie Chen is following her with his men.

63
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,570
Shiyu.

64
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,250
Shiyu.

65
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,220
- Shiyu.
- Your Grace.

66
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,050
Since you came back from Dongyu,

67
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,680
you've seldom visited me.

68
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,010
Lately, I have too many
official and private things to do.

69
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,170
Yeah, Your Grace.

70
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,480
His Highness has to go to the palace soon.

71
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:18,210
You're going there as soon as I come.

72
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,480
Shiyu, are you alienating me

73
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,680
just because you're engaged?

74
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,440
Princess of Dongyu is my consort.

75
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,290
I should care about her.

76
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,170
Shiyu, now you really

77
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,050
care for that Dongyu woman, huh?

78
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,800
Luoyi, she is your cousin-in-law.

79
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,410
Show some respect.

80
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,240
I won't!

81
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,880
(Zhenlai Store)
Xingyi, how about this?

82
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,290
Let's stop giving Miss Su Nian a hard time,

83
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,530
shall we?

84
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,920
Yueling, you get it wrong.

85
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,920
She gives me a hard time.

86
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,800
But she...

87
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,880
Let go of me!

88
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,850
Attention, everybody.

89
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,770
(Huangsi Restaurant)
She's the slave

90
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:01,770
I bought with money.

91
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,850
How can I just release her?

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,530
She can't be released.

93
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,560
I've collected enough money to redeem myself.

94
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,480
Why can I not be released?

95
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,680
Because you're from Dongyu.

96
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,250
Oh, she's from Dongyu.

97
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,320
Dongyu people can't be redeemed.

98
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,320
Why?

99
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,730
In the Capital City,

100
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,170
Dongyu people are just pariahs.

101
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,770
Redeem? Funny.

102
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:31,560
Mr. Huang has a point.

103
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,170
Dongyu people are ungrateful.

104
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,010
Ungrateful.

105
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,680
Yeah. They're ungrateful people.

106
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,990
- Ungrateful people.
- Ungrateful people.

107
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,120
Why do Dongyu people

108
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,850
have to be slaves here?

109
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,120
Where are you from, stranger?

110
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,770
How do you not know this rule?

111
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,120
If she wasn't a slave,

112
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,240
she would be unregistered and homeless.

113
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,650
Detected by the government, anyone like this

114
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,560
has to be expelled from the Capital City!

115
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,880
That's right.

116
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,210
Yeah. Don't let her go.

117
00:05:58,610 --> 00:05:59,880
Release this girl.

118
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,090
Or I'll be rude to you.

119
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:04,680
Interfere with my business?

120
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:05,810
You must have a death wish.

121
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,320
They beat me!

122
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,970
Help!

123
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,960
Hel...

124
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,240
Officer, help me.

125
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,770
These two guys stand up for this Dongyu slave

126
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,480
and they even want to kill me.

127
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,360
Do me justice, please.

128
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,440
You bullied her first.

129
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,410
How dare you talk nonsense and slander us?

130
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:35,730
Don't trust their nonsense.

131
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,170
Arrest them. Arrest them.

132
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,050
Take them away!

133
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,410
Yeah. Take them away.

134
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,250
Arrest them.

135
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,160
Go.

136
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,050
Go.

137
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,200
Let me go.

138
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,200
Let me go!

139
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,420
(The Capital Government)

140
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,210
Let us out, you people!

141
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,050
I'm innocent.

142
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,880
I'm innocent. I really am.

143
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,320
Let us out of here.

144
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,610
Don't you know who we are?

145
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,770
Let us out of here.

146
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:00,770
I'm innocent.

147
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,120
Somebody! Somebody come!

148
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,920
Where are you from, stranger?

149
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,650
How do you not know this rule?

150
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,000
If she wasn't a slave,

151
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,210
she would be unregistered and homeless.

153
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,800
has to be expelled from the Capital City!

154
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:28,810
I'm Qiyun,

155
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,240
thank you for helping me.

156
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:34,530
Not at all, Miss.

157
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,240
We didn't actually help.

158
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,680
I got you into this.

159
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:42,240
You stood up for Dongyu people in public.

160
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,480
In the Capital City,

161
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:46,530
this is really rare.

162
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:50,610
I never knew

163
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,970
life was so hard for Dongyu people

164
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,290
in the Capital City.

165
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,920
What's worse,

166
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,090
they say

167
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,000
Dongyu people are pariahs.

168
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:00,970
In Beishuo,

169
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,920
there are pariahs and civilians.

170
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,800
Three generations of criminals

171
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,560
are the sinners.

172
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,920
Music workers in entertainment places

173
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,000
are musicians.

174
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,880
In the Capital City,

175
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,530
those who stay for work

176
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,240
without private estates

177
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,410
are slaves.

178
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,610
Sinners, musicians, and slaves

179
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,850
are all pariahs?

180
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,650
(In Beishuo,)

181
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:42,370
(people have to obey this terrible hierarchy.)

(The North Prince's Mansion)

183
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,520
Your Grace.

184
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,010
We just got the information

185
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,080
that the Princess of Dongyu and her guard

186
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,250
were imprisoned
in the Capital Government by mistake.

187
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,370
It's really something new.

188
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,170
Shiyu didn't send anyone to save her?

189
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,170
His Highness is in the palace now.

190
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,720
Just her luck.

191
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:13,600
Your brother always wants you

192
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,320
to marry the North Prince.

193
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,600
But the Princess of Dongyu

194
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,170
makes His Highness care less about you.

195
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:22,290
In my opinion, when His Highness is away now,

196
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,010
why don't we give her a lesson?

197
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,010
How?

198
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,440
How about this?

199
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,600
We can first do this

200
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,440
and then...

201
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,170
Shiyu, do you think

202
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,130
we can win this game?

203
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,170
It's hard to win.

204
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,290
But we may not lose, either.

205
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:59,600
We must do easy things before hard ones.

206
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:03,010
Small things before great ones.

207
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,440
Shiyu, I admire your determination

208
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,770
of this game.

209
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,440
Playing all alone,

210
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,890
I had to push my enemy into the trap.

211
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,130
But I got you into trouble many times.

212
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,890
I feel quite guilty.

213
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,290
Brother, you and I

214
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,250
have been stuck in the same crisis.

215
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,720
To get rid of this crisis,

216
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:28,600
I'm willing to be your weapon.

217
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,290
When you and I work of one mind,

218
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,920
even if we're weak and all alone,

219
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,600
we'll still be able to turn the tide and win.

220
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,820
(Hall of Politics)

221
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,200
Eunuch Li, something terrible happened.

222
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,960
Please tell His Highness about it.

223
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,560
But...

224
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,840
His Majesty is playing chess
with the North Prince in there.

225
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,560
No one is allowed to disturb them.

226
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,960
Eunuch Li, this is really urgent.

227
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,290
Please, Eunuch Li.

228
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,200
Sir, you look really anxious.

229
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,890
I'll get in and tell them, then.

230
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,010
Thank you, Eunuch Li.

231
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,600
Somebody!

232
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,250
Anybody there?

233
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,770
Let us out!

234
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,050
Let us out of here.

235
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,080
Yueling, don't be scared.

236
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,130
When the mayor interrogates us,

237
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,800
we'll tell them who we are.

238
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,320
Then he won't dare to be so rude.

239
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,650
I'm not scared.

240
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,370
I just didn't know

241
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,770
Dongyu people had to be slaves

242
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,650
in the Capital City.

243
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,890
Come in, please, My Lord.

244
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,080
Is that Wen Yu?

245
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:52,920
Do you mean them?

246
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,890
Yes. The two of them.

247
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,210
They made a scene on the street.

248
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,280
How silly!

249
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,410
They're the North Prince's guests.

250
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,320
How dare you mistreat them?

251
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,370
Sorry, I didn't recognize them.

252
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:05,370
What are you waiting for?

253
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:06,210
Go open the door.

254
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,200
Yes.

255
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,960
Come in, please, My Lord.

256
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,250
Sorry, we did you an injustice.

257
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:15,600
His Highness sent someone to tell us

258
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,560
you were his guests.

259
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,800
I checked it carefully,

260
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,680
only to find it's just a misunderstanding

261
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,050
So, can we leave now?

262
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,210
Yes, of course.

263
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:26,960
We'll take her out, too.

264
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,800
No.

265
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,250
Her master has come to get her back.

266
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,560
He's waiting out there.

267
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,130
He won't be good to her.

268
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,080
Why can't she leave with us?

269
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,890
She's still a slave

270
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,800
and can't leave without permission.

271
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,200
This is against the national law.

272
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,460
(The Capital Government)

273
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:00,970
Come over.

274
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:04,890
Take her away.

275
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,250
If it happens again,

276
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:09,490
see how I'll punish you!

277
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,960
Yueling, look.

278
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,170
The carriage from the North Prince.

279
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,650
This way, please, Your Highness.

280
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,320
Did you come here alone?

281
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,770
His Highness wanted us to keep a low profile

282
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,170
instead of bringing the blame.

283
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,530
So, I was sent here alone.

284
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,800
Fine.

285
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:41,890
Are we there yet?

286
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,800
This isn't the way back.

287
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,200
Where are you taking us?

288
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:02,490
Give it to me.

289
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,160
Xingyi.

290
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:20,250
You...

291
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,280
Yueling.

292
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:29,490
Yueling!

293
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:24,050
Xingyi, Xingyi.

294
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,890
Xingyi, wake up.

295
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,320
We are trapped.

296
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,250
One, two, three.

297
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,250
Your Highness, Her Highness
was kidnapped to Shili Hill.

298
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,800
Gather our men to fight there.

299
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:48,890
Yes.

300
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,010
Hyah.

301
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,970
Change of plan.

302
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,750
The North Princess Consort
isn't coming here tonight.

303
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,330
You leave now.

304
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,320
I'm afraid

305
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,320
you can't leave.

306
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:22,850
Your Highness,

307
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,080
the groom confessed everything.

308
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:25,970
They were sent by Princess Luoyi.

309
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,720
Luoyi?

310
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:30,770
Yes.

311
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,880
How shall we deal with these dark guards

312
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,080
from her family?

313
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:39,730
Kill them all.

314
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:41,890
Yes.

315
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,680
Wen Yu.

316
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,600
Wen Yu!

317
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,520
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

318
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:15,560
Is Her Grace back?

319
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,050
- No.
- No.

320
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,240
Yueling.

321
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,240
Wen Yu.

322
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:28,570
Wen Yu.

323
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:31,570

Why were you even imprisoned?

336
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,080
Come on.

337
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,010
There are not only a lot of rules in Beishuo,

338
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,690
but also a terrible hierarchy.

339
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,360
What hierarchy?

340
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,530
Miss Qiyun, I mean.

341
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,490
The Dongyu girl we tried to save today.

342
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,880
I never knew Dongyu people

343
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,770
had to live

344
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:16,640
such a miserable life in Beishuo.

345
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,250
She's still a slave

346
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,400
and can't ever be released.

347
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,160
How could there be such a ridiculous law?

348
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,490
What do you want to do, then?

349
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:28,770
I'm the Princess of Dongyu.

350
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,160
Since I'm here,

351
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:32,600
I must get my people out of their misery

352
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,080
and abolish this law for them.

353
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:41,290
Yueling, you're ambitious

354
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,880
and you care for your people.

355
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:45,210
But you can't abolish this law

356
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,210
in a very short time.

357
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,930
And you can't change anything all alone.

358
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,600
I totally understand.

359
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,800
But I can't just watch and do nothing.

360
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:03,370
Wen Yu,

361
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,800
can you do something to help me?

362
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:09,610
All I can do

363
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,090
is try my best.

364
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,770
But it was really dangerous today.

365
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,050
In the future, don't go out alone

366
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,640
unless I'm around.

367
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,340
(Benign and Benevolent)

368
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:53,930
Your Grace, have something to eat.

369
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,970
How could you not eat anything?

370
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,880
Yueling, I'm back.

371
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,530
Your Highness.

372
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,360
Oh, so many delicious dishes.

373
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,730
Did you make inquiries about Qiyun?

374
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:07,770
As instructed by you,

375
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,800
I sent some money and clothes to Qiyun.

376
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,640
Then Mr. Huang became less rude

377
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,600
to her.

378
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:14,810
That's good.

379
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:17,330
Good.

380
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,080
This part looks so annoying.

381
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,160
Your Grace, Your Grace.

382
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:29,770
The North Prince is here.

383
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,290
The North Prince?

384
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,640
Shiyu.

385
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,680
Shiyu.

386
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,400
Since my cousin, the Lord of the South,
defended the border,

387
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,010
he's trusted me with you.

388
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,250
I think I've been taking good care of you.

389
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,880
I really wonder

390
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,210
what I've done wrong to you.

391
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:52,360
Nothing. Why do you say that, Shiyu?

392
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,400
In this case,

393
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,770
why did you hurt Her Highness?

394
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,930
I don't know what you're talking about, Shiyu.

395
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,560
I don't understand. I...

396
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,450
The special secret weapon of your dark guards.

397
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,970
Others may not recognize it. But I can.

398
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,160
I...

399
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,560
I just meant to scare her.

400
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,490
I wouldn't really kill her.

401
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,400
Ping'er can be my witness.

402
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,530
I just asked my guards

403
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,560
to scare your consort.

404
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,690
That's true, Your Highness.

405
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,600
Please don't be angry.

406
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,360
Her Grace wouldn't kill her.

407
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,200
Are you sure?

408
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,970
It's capable of you, Princess Luoyi.

409
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:30,970
Your guards dared to kill
even without your order.

410
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,800
Looks like I don't need to worry.

411
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,120
Staying in my small mansion

412
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,880
may do you an injustice.

413
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,120
Shiyu, are you kicking me out?

414
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,560
For that Dongyu woman, you...

415
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,360
Shiyu, why do you defend her like this?

416
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,770
Let me say it again.

417
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,930
She is the North Princess Consort.

418
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,730
Shiyu, I'm wrong.

419
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,970
I just lost my mind.

420
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,970
Give me a second chance.

421
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:02,450
I'll behave myself

422
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,080
and I won't be her enemy anymore.

423
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,250
But Shiyu, don't kick me out.

424
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,120
I beg you.

425
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,770
Let me stay by your side.

426
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,090
Somebody.

427
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,600
Send Princess Luoyi back to the palace

428
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,530
and have her belongings cleared away, too.

429
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:51,960
Su Nian,

430
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,080
that Dongyu man

431
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,250
and the woman in the portrait were taken away.

432
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:57,490
And I saw them

433
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,180
followed by the dark guards
of the North Prince.

434
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,320
Dark guards of the North Prince?

435
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,770
(Who are they?)

436
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,210
(What's their relationship
with the North Prince?)

437
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,050
Su Nian,

438
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:12,800
how about I kidnap that woman tonight

439
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,730
and interrogate her?

440
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,050
Don't.

441
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,840
You may alert the North Prince's men.

442
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:18,850
Then we'll be in trouble.

443
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,400
I crossed paths with that Dongyu man.

444
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,450
You go and have him come over.

445
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,600
But Su Nian...

446
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,640
Just do this.

447
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,930
I have my plan.

448
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:30,770
Yes, Su Nian.

449
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:44,690
So, this is your plan
to kill two birds with one stone?

450
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,490
If it had succeeded,

451
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:54,120
the Princess of Dongyu would
have been killed by Princess Luoyi.

452
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,690
The alliance between the Lord of the South

453
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:57,160
and the North Prince would collapse.

454
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,770
Prime Minister, my plan was perfect.

455
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,250
But this is really weird.

456
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,250
The Princess of Dongyu and the North Prince

457
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:07,050
seem to foresee the future.

458
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,250
Foresee the future?

459
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,530
I'm...

460
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,320
I'm trying to figure out why they can do that.

461
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:21,010
Since the marriage thing,

462
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,120
you've been making mistakes.

463
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,730
Lin Su,

464
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,560
I gave you way too many chances.

465
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,770
Prime Minister, please give me one last chance.

466
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,050
This time,

467
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:38,160
I'll make sure the Princess of Dongyu dies.

468
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,640
Please give me one last chance.

469
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:48,970
What is Zhou Shiyu doing lately?

470
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:50,840
He sent someone to Liuzhou secretly.

471
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,250
Nan Xun is stalking him.

472
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,290
Liuzhou?

473
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,450
Miss Qiyun cooks so perfectly.

474
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,730
It's the taste of our hometown.

475
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:07,360
According to Miss Qiyun,

476
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,690
the pastry will be our present.

477
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,160
Since we warned Mr. Huang last time,

478
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,450
she's been living a much better life.

479
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,690
Glad to hear that.

480
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:16,530
Let me taste some.

481
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,320
The fresh milk cake tastes really good.

482
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:21,600
I'll leave this to Wen Yu.

483
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,120
Wen Yu?

484
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:24,960
Yueling,

485
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,600
you can't be in love with him, can you?

486
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:29,600
Lo... Love?

487
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,080
How's that possible?

488
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,770
I'll just thank him for saving my life.

489
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:35,290
Saving your life?

490
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,770
Well,

491
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,490
I think I saw Wen Yu die for you.

492
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,490
Die for me?

493
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,320
I had a dream before.

494
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:51,930
In the dream, you were killed

495
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,970
and Wen Yu killed himself for you.

496
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,050
That dream was so real.

497
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,730
Your Highness, don't be ridiculous.

498
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,880
Her Grace is the North Princess Consort.

499
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,450
If she has some gossip with Wen Yu,

500
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,120
her reputation

501
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,690
will be ruined.

502
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:10,840
You must not talk nonsense.

503
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,970
But I always think

504
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,210
Wen Yu and Yueling make a perfect couple.

505
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,450
(Wen Yu and I?)

506
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,620
(Pleasant and Harmonious)

507
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,490
(Stay Modest)
Your Highness, at your command,

508
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,320
Nie Chen has secretly
gone to Liuzhou to take over

509
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,450
(Memorial to the Throne)
the private soldiers trained by Mr. Liu.

510
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,560
I get it. Leave me.

511
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,720
Anything else?

512
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,730
Your Highness, there's a small thing

513
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,800
I think I should tell you.

514
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:39,960
Go ahead.

515
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,930
Lately, Her Highness has been

516
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,450
looking for a martial guard named Wen Yu.

517
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:46,840
(I think it's time to tell her)

518
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,290
(who I really am.)

519
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:51,370
That's right.

520
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,970
Smells so good.

521
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:04,960
Here.

522
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:06,570
Thanks.

523
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:14,930
How much is the sugar?

524
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,720
Two wen for half a kilo.
[*ancient Chinese penny]

525
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,160
You're looking for me, huh?

526
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,840
Why are you stalking me

527
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:44,640
so sneakily?

528
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:50,160
I'm the maid of Miss Su Nian,

529
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,600
the unsurpassed lady in the House of Romance.

530
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,080
She wants to invite you to a chat.

531
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,400
So, she sent me to get you there.

532
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,440
Su Nian?

533
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,290
Yes, exactly.

534
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,090
I'm not going.

535
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:05,050
You and your lady are weird.

536
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,640
What kind of invitation is this?

537
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,360
Just now, I saw you doing some shopping

538
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,490
very happily.

539
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:13,080
So, I didn't dare to disturb you.

540
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,770
Please don't blame me.

541
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,450
Forget it. You go back and tell her

542
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,690
that I mistook her for someone else.

543
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:20,900
Sorry to have offended her.

544
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:23,450
But she must not have any intentions

545
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,600
towards me just because of this.

546
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:28,970
In this case,

547
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,120
how about you go and tell her personally?

548
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,080
Miss Su Nian has been
waiting for you the whole day.

549
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,120
She is the unsurpassed lady.

550
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,690
But in private,

551
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:41,360
she has never met a young man before.

552
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,530
If you don't go,

553
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,530
I will not know how to explain this.

554
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,010
When I'm back,

555
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:56,320
I will certainly be punished.

556
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,560
It's my fault.

557
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,160
I shouldn't have stalked you

558
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,970
and you even misunderstood me.

559
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,920
Fine, then.

560
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,610
You take me there.

561
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:15,130
All right.

562
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,640
Miss Qianqian,

563
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,560
the jerky sticks look quite delicious.

564
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:31,730
Mr. Lin?

565
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:33,690
Your Highness

566
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:35,640
doesn't allow our princess
to enter the western yard, huh?

567
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,210
What are you doing here, then?

568
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:38,490
Miss Qianqian,

569
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,640
did you eat too many jerky sticks?

570
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,560
Why are you so angry?

571
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:46,080
This is the way I talk

572
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,360
and I'm not angry.

573
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,560
No offense, Mr. Lin.

574
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:52,880
Well, I thought too much, then.

575
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,250
Oh, Miss Qianqian,

576
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:55,970
I'm here to send a message.

577
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,970
Wen Yu invited Her Grace out for a talk.

578
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:00,560
Wen Yu invited Her Grace?

579
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,690
Yes. And Wen Yu

580
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:04,080
invited her alone.

581
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:05,450
Alone?

582
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,490
How can he do that? I...

583
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:10,010
Miss Qianqian, please tell Her Grace about it.

584
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:20,740
(Silver Note of Beishuo Bank)

585
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:23,120
How much money has Xingyi spent?

586
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,400
I can hardly raise him.

587
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,440
Your Grace.

588
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,840
Your Grace, Mr. Lin is here.

589
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,730
He brought a message for Wen Yu,

590
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,640
inviting you out.

591
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,770
Why did Lin Mu send the message?

592
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,210
He came, indeed.

593
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:46,640
He also said, Wen Yu only invited you.

594
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,290
Your Grace, you may be in danger out there.

595
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:51,800
How about I reject him?

596
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,240
Don't.

597
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:55,320
When Wen Yu is around,

598
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:56,770
I won't be in danger.

599
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,010
Don't worry. Come on.

600
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:01,560
Go pick a nice dress for me.

601
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,530
But…

602
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,930
Su Nian, he is here.

603
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:14,840
I get it. Leave us.

604
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:27,930
Greetings, gentleman.

605
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,970
I mistook you for someone else.

606
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,840
I'm... I'm sorry.

607
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:39,130
Gentleman,

608
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,080
there seems to be...

609
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,080
A misunderstanding between us.

610
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:46,210
We... We should keep our distance.

611
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:49,570
Be seated, please.

612
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,730
In the House of Romance, you once protected me.

613
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:58,770
I'm really grateful.

614
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,970
So, I prepared some wine.

615
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,560
Hope

616
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:06,730
you can let go of what happened

617
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,640
and drink with me.

618
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:11,120
Before, I mistook you for an assassin.

619
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,080
So, we are...

620
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,930
We are even.

621
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:23,680
Now, our misunderstanding is gone.

622
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,240
I'll take my leave, then.

623
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:30,370
Do you really dislike me this much?

624
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:32,240
That's not true.

625
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,240
Yeah.

626
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:37,010
I'm from a humble family

627
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,010
and now I'm a musician.

628
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:42,240
Who will

629
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:44,560
really protect me?

630
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,120
No.

631
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,280
We Dongyu people

632
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,280
don't have a hierarchy.

633
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,080
- Is that true?
- I never lie.

634
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:54,490
In this case,

635
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:57,730
please drink with me.

636
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,170
All right.

637
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,560
A... A toast to you.

638
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,450
Come have a look. Sachets for sale.

639
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:41,050
I'm going to fly a kite, too.

640
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,070
Pendants for sale.

641
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,080
Pendants for sale.

642
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:46,320
Sir, come have a look.

643
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:49,210
What are you looking at?

644
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:51,920
Look.

645
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,970
Sir, how many fish have you caught?

646
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,530
One.

647
00:35:58,010 --> 00:35:59,600
I've got more than half a bucket.

648
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,330
Look, the bucket is nearly full.

649
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:03,050
Tonight, come to my home for some wine.

650
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:04,810
All right. I'll be there.

651
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,810
It's such a great life.

652
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:15,370
Yeah.

653
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,600
It's great.
