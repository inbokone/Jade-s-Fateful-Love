(Dongyu)

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.220
(Ashina Yueling,
the Young Princess of Dongyu)

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.180
Milk tea rolls, cheese packets,

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.480
and glutinous rice cake with raisins.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.480
All the pastry my eldest sister loves.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.020
(Hope everything will go smoothly)

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.840
(after she gets married in Beishuo.)

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.040
Oh, Xingyi.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.820
Yueling, you cook so perfectly.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.040
(Ashina Xingyi, the Young Prince of Dongyu)
No other sister can make

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.800
better pastry than you.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.620
Confess. You were away for a while.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.640
Did you make trouble again?

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.600
Well,

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.160
is there any chance that...?

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.360
That your pocket money isn't enough?

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:00.620
Yes.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.380
The farewell dinner will be held tonight.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.340
Don't be late.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.580
You always care the most for me, Yueling.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.420
Don't worry.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.460
Whatever you want me to do,

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.720
I'll do it for you.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:09.780
I should go.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:10.780
Don't be late.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.620
I won't.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.000
Your Grace,

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.940
why are you still making the pastry?

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:15.800
You should go get changed.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.630
(Qianqian, the maid of Dongyu)
If His Majesty sees this,

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.300
he'll complain again.

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.580
"You don't look like a princess."

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.380
"You either travel around, fighting with people

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.840
or cooking in the kitchen."

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.800
I've been getting an earful of that.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.140
Under the North Prince's order,

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.180
we'll make camp before nightfall
and rest for one night!

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.920
Tomorrow, we'll go get the Princess of Dongyu!

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.620
(Zhou Shiyu, the North Prince of Beishuo)

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.860
Ashina Zhu, the Eldest Princess,

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.620
will be married to Beishuo.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.360
Our good days are coming.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.340
Yeah.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.900
Finally, we don't need to fight wars.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:08.880
Yes.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.620
Beishuo has delivered

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.940
the food for us to get through the winter.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:13.840
That's great.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:15.820
Yueling,

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:16.700
come and dance.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.120
Your Grace, come and dance.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:26.880
Watch this.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.140
You guys dance.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.660
Let's wish Her Grace

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.860
- a smooth journey.
- Wish her a smooth journey.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.840
Zhu, let's go dancing.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.040
What's wrong?

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.300
Why did you drink so much?

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.960
You're getting married tomorrow.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.300
(Ashina Zhu, the Eldest Princess of Dongyu)

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.960
Isn't this Du Er's piccolo?

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.880
I thought you dumped it.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.080
You still care for him?

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.180
Zhu,

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.400
you don't get married, then.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:18.680
I'll go tell Father.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:21.500
Yueling,

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:22.720
you don't understand.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.200
The marriage of the two states is important.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.820
Princesses like us

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.520
have our responsibilities to bear.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.240
Zhu, if you hate to get married,

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.060
just don't.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.680
If you worry about the alliance,

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.100
I'll replace you in the worst case.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.300
I'll go beg Father.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.920
Nothing matters more than your happiness.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.040
Don't go.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.660
I'll get married.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.840
I will.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.080
If you don't want this,

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.240
when Beishuo's escort comes tomorrow,

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:54.640
I'll take care of them.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.560
Yueling,

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.180
I'm leaving tomorrow.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.800
How about you drink with me?

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.860
Come on.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.000
Zhu, if you want to drink,

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.880
I'll drink with you.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.080
Yueling, wake up.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.140
Yueling, wake up. Come on.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.180
- Xingyi.
- Yueling.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.520
Don't bother me.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.600
Don't wake me up before the day breaks.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.300
I'll break off our sister's engagement.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.140
Break off?

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.480
What are you talking about?

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.000
She left a long time ago.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.880
What did you say?

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.200
She left?

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:45.760
More than that.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.000
I'm afraid

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:48.760
she's out of Dongyu now.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.520
Oh, no.

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.840
Why was I so drunk?

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:57.180
Hyah!

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:59.020
Hyah!

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.180
Hyah!

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:05.340
Hyah!

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.220
(Yueling,)

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.480
(it's what a princess like me should do.)

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.560
(I have to get married.)

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:22.980
Your Highness,

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.400
you said this trip
would be extremely dangerous.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.100
But I think we're traveling

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.660
(Lin Mu, the North Prince's guard)
quite smoothly.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.200
I'm afraid

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.200
it's the peace before the storm.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:43.600
Yueling,

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.720
are you going to take Sister back by force?

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.860
Isn't it inappropriate?

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:49.700
Scared?

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.120
How... How would I?

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.360
I just think they have too many guards.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.360
Yeah, Your Grace.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:01.920
What's the sound?

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.760
Music of our state.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:09.760
It's Du Er.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:10.960
Du Er?

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.500
He's quite weak.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.820
What is he here for?

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.160
Does he also want to take Zhu back by force?

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:20.460
You know what?

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.520
The Dongyu music sounds good.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.540
(Du Er, the diplomat of Dongyu)

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.880
Come on. Let's get to Du Er.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.780
(Posthouse)

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:56.760
Tonight, you have to be on your guard

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:58.620
in case someone sneaks in

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.060
and hurts the princess.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:00.900
- Aye!
- Aye!

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:22.740
Stop.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.020
What are you here for?

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.640
To deliver some pastry to Her Grace.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:29.300
Get in there.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:50.500
Zhu.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.340
Zhu.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:54.540
Zhu.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.420
Let's switch clothes.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.040
Go out of the yard through the back door.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.700
Qianqian and Du Er
are waiting in the back alley.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.740
Xingyi and I will stay to stall for time.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:05.180
Yueling, what are you doing?

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.000
Helping you elope with Du Er.

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:09.000
This is absurd.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:10.440
You just get back.

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:12.540
Zhu, Zhu.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.380
I know what you're worried about.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.420
When possible,

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:16.580
I'll steal the letter of marriage

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.800
and burn the posthouse down.

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.020
By then,

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.820
Beishuo guards fail to keep the letter

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:22.920
and we won't be involved.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.140
If they want to start a war again,

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.840
they'll be restrained by the other states.

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:29.260
How can I leave you here alone

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.440
in such risks?

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:53.200
That's great.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:54.680
Our plan worked.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.040
Next, everything counts on me.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.200
It's such a great day.

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:06.680
Beishuo buddies,

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:08.360
how about we drink some, too?

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.400
I've brought some nice beef.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.540
Let me fill your cups.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.140
Instead of standing guard,

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:15.360
you're here for some wine.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:16.960
Go away.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:20.560
- Go.
- Today is a big day for our princess.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.520
Let's drink, buddies.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.100
(I must search quickly.)

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.520
(Or the drug will wear off soon.)

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.420
(Where is the North Prince)

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:11.280
(keeping the letter of marriage?)

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:28.140
What are you looking for?

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:29.320
The letter of marriage.

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.940
I... I guess

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.740
I'm in the wrong room.

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.200
Sorry. I get the wrong guy.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:12:59.660
Who are you?

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.490
Why do you want
to steal the letter of marriage?

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.640
What letter of marriage?

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:06.520
I'm just a thief.

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.420
When I saw you come for the wedding thing,

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.280
I tried to steal some money.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:13.700
I'll confess. I will.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.020
I know you're the North Prince.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.500
So, I think you're the richest.

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:19.340
To steal some money,

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.000
I certainly want to pick the richest man.

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:22.600
You think I'm the North Prince?

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:24.800
Well, you get the wrong guy.

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:26.600
Isn't this the North Prince's room?

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:30.240
(Martial Guard)
I'm a mere martial guard.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:33.080
(No wonder I can't
find the letter of marriage.)

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:34.680
(So, it's not the prince's room.)

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:39.300
Hey, martial guard.

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:41.620
Look, I haven't stolen anything.

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.520
How about this?

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:46.440
You let me go.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:51.840
I won't go.

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:53.900
I just won't.

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:11.420
Not enough?

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:12.320
I'll give you more, then.

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:18.720
Still not enough?

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:34.540
It's pretty much, actually.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.980
It's hard for me to save up money.

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:38.340
And I have a naughty brother to raise.

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:39.280
How about we...?

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:42.600
Let go of each other.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.380
This is all that I have, sir.

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:47.740
As the North Prince's bodyguard,

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.700
I'm here to catch a thief

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:51.560
instead of dealing with her.

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:53.020
Got it?

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:55.160
Yes, yes.

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:05.040
It's really greedy of you.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.240
(Maybe he knows
where the letter of marriage is.)

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.320
(He can't die.)

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:28.040
They're dead.

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:54.200
(Why am I still here?)

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:57.320
- It's you again?
- It's you again?

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.880
Weren't we killed just now?

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.680
Why are we still here?

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:05.420
Did I have a nightmare?

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:07.120
You have the same memory as mine?

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:08.260
Will there

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:10.480
really be assassins?

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:12.600
As... assassins?

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:16.040
Who assassinated us?

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:17.840
Why would they?

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:20.640
I don't think we're the only target.

00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:24.560
Dongyu?

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:25.740
Somebody!

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:28.840
Assassins will come.

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.060
Stand by, everybody!

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:30.920
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:55.440
Xingyi.

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:56.980
You...

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:57.820
Yueling,

00:17:58.540 --> 00:17:59.400
I'm all right.

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.680
Go check on the princess in the room.

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:19.080
It hurts so much.

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.060
Your Grace,

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:32.580
I'm still too late!

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:33.460
Your Grace,

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:35.780
the assassins kidnapped you!

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:37.160
Your Grace!

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.360
Oh, Your Grace!

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:43.860
Your Grace, we failed to protect you.

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:45.980
Princess Zhu isn't in the room.

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:47.580
When you're kidnapped,

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:50.920
how can we explain this to His Majesty?

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.380
Oh, Your Grace!

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:56.300
You protected Her Grace poorly

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:57.940
so that she was gone.

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:00.460
I saw the assassins take Her Grace away.

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:01.640
They're so vicious.

00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:02.800
Her Grace

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.800
will die soon.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:08.200
Oh, Your Grace.

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:09.680
Interesting.

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:11.420
Our Princess Zhu

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.480
has died for no reason.

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:15.580
Why isn't your prince coming out

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:16.820
to explain this?

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:18.440
Yeah. Where's he?

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:20.880
Don't think

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.240
you can see our prince

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:25.720
just as you wish.

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:34.740
Something so terrible happened.

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.480
He's supposed to explain it.

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:39.140
So far,

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.520
he hasn't shown up.

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.100
Can your prince

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.400
be too devious to be seen?

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:46.220
Yeah.

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:47.540
Where's your prince?

00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:48.800
Don't talk nonsense.

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.080
Who are you, Miss?

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:53.420
Why do you insist

00:19:53.420 --> 00:19:55.440
that your princess is dead?

00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:57.940
Anyway, I saw the assassins

00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:58.840
take her away.

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:00.620
It's very likely

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:02.060
that she's dead now.

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:04.800
You people are to blame.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:07.860
Right.

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:10.840
You're to blame.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:13.100
Are you all right?

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:23.360
- Leave us.
- Yes.

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:26.940
Your Highness,

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:29.000
no betrothal presents were stolen.

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:31.060
I just didn't expect

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.080
the Roufeng Sect to be so impatient.

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.080
What about the Dongyu escort?

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:37.760
They're still asking for trouble.

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:41.050
A dozen of our people were dead or injured.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:43.400
But they lost nearly

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:44.960
half of their people.

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:47.240
Looks like

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:49.800
Dongyu people didn't

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:51.360
collude with the Roufeng Sect.

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:53.820
But when the Eldest Princess is gone,

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.460
instead of searching for her,

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:57.520
they insist that she's dead.

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:00.000
Don't you think it's weird?

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:02.000
Your Highness, are you saying

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:05.480
they actually stole their princess

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:08.880
and have been hiding her?

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:13.640
Keep a close eye on the two of them.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.600
Don't let them run away.

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:19.300
Yes.

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:21.160
Yueling,

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:23.700
we've been on the run for a long time.

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:25.480
Why haven't we reached Dongyu yet?

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:27.340
Xingyi, hang in there.

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:28.400
We're arriving soon.

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:30.520
Yueling,

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:32.840
am I dying?

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.060
Back in Dongyu,

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:37.780
I'll have the witch doctor detoxify you.

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:38.700
You won't die.

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:40.400
Where are you going to run?

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:44.540
He's poisoned with the toxin
from the Roufeng Sect,

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.000
the No.1 Assassin Group in Beishuo.

00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:48.860
Nothing can detoxify him,

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:50.080
except their own antidote.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:53.600
Don't try to scare us.

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:55.680
I don't need to.

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.220
In less than a dozen days,

00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:58.920
this young man will be dead.

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:02.360
Yueling.

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:11.000
It's easy for him to kill us now.

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:13.360
He doesn't seem to be lying.

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:17.040
But I'm still so young.

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.960
I don't want to die like this.

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.300
Well, tell me.

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:26.580
Where is the Roufeng Sect?

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:27.720
How can I get the antidote?

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.720
Only when you go to Beishuo with me

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:32.280
can you possibly get it.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.360
Failing the agreement,

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:35.820
you lost the princess of marriage.

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:37.640
Do we have to die there, too?

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:40.620
You and your brother are weird.

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:43.040
You inexplicably popped up in the escort

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:45.480
and sneaked into our prince's room
to steal the letter of marriage.

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:49.000
As for where the real princess is...

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:50.960
I guess you know that better than I do.

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:55.020
I'm Princess Zhu's maid

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:56.000
and this is my younger brother.

00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:58.100
Greatly indebted to Her Grace,

00:22:58.100 --> 00:22:58.960
we came to say farewell.

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:00.580
What letter?

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:01.580
I don't understand.

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:02.760
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:05.180
You failed to protect Her Grace as agreed

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:06.300
and finally lost her.

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:07.420
What does it have to us?

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:08.360
Yeah.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.020
All right.

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:11.780
If you don't go to Beishuo with me,

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.520
your brother will die.

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:16.520
If we go with you,

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:18.640
can you save him?

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:22.120
I'll look for the antidote for you

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:25.120
and you'll conceal
the disappearance of the princess.

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:26.940
It's a good deal for you.

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.180
The princess is really missing.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:30.420
How can we conceal it?

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:33.000
Or you want me to give you another princess?

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:36.880
It sounds feasible.

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:42.160
Do you mean

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:43.900
you want me to be her?

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.780
You must not use my sister!

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:46.620
Xingyi.

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:51.240
How about we approve now?

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:52.660
When we get the antidote,

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:53.680
we can sneak away.

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:55.140
Fine, then.

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:56.600
We'll sneak away together.

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:00.400
We'll take this deal.

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:22.280
We died, indeed.

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:26.400
(But we came back to life.)

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:28.000
(Is it)

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:30.560
(because of the jade pendant
given by the necromancer?)

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:34.300
Your Highness,

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:35.800
you must be tired after the whole day.

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:37.040
Have some refreshments.

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:39.640
What have you got?

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:41.260
I asked around.

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:42.390
They said the girl and the young man

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:44.040
grew up with Princess Zhu.

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:46.820
Yueling is the maid

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:47.880
while Xingyi is the bodyguard.

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:50.520
And you believe that?

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:52.760
Is it not true?

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:55.920
They can't be ordinary people.

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:57.580
But our top priority

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:59.280
is to complete the marriage thing.

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:01.240
Her identity does not matter.

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:03.400
What matters is
that she is the princess of marriage.

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:09.860
Maybe the adventure brought by this girl

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:12.160
can be the key to a smooth trip.

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:14.140
And they must not know

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:15.600
who I really am.

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:26.040
What?

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:27.560
Do I look like the princess?

00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:30.180
Yes, really.

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:31.760
It restrains me so much.

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:40.880
Showing your face before the marriage

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:42.720
is against the rules, huh?

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.160
Don't bother.

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:47.440
I'm not the real princess of marriage.

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:49.160
Rules aren't for me.

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:51.740
I can guarantee the Dongyu escort

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:53.360
will remain tight-lipped about my identity.

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:55.080
Can you convince

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:56.180
Beishuo guards?

00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:59.180
Guards for this escort

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:00.740
are fully trusted by the North Prince.

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.020
I'm confident enough to convince His Highness

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:05.360
to silence his guards about this.

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:08.480
Something so terrible happened.

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:10.080
Where's the North Prince?

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:11.880
Isn't he supposed to talk with me?

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:14.980
Due to the assassination,

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:16.520
His Highness has left.

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:21.720
Such a cowardly prince.

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:23.960
In case of trouble, he was the first to escape.

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:28.080
You complain about His Highness
in front of his subordinate.

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:30.160
Isn't it inappropriate?

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:33.480
Never mind.

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:38.120
Let's stick to our plan, then.

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:39.760
We made the deal.

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:42.120
I'll pretend to be the princess for the moment.

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:43.620
When we're in the Capital City,

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.640
you must find the antidote for my brother.

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:47.280
Play your roles perfectly

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:49.120
and I'll keep my promise.

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:51.000
Don't worry.

00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:59.760
Umm...

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:02.940
My... My money.

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:04.480
You should give it back to me, huh?

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:06.980
When you pretend to be the princess,

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:08.940
you'll take over her dowry, too.

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:09.780
You won't still care

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:11.520
for a little bit of money, will you?

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:14.340
I...

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:17.040
Why did you shut the door?

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:19.060
I don't think you won't come out again.

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:20.240
I'll be waiting here.

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:26.220
Take it back.

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:31.240
So generous?

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:39.840
Why are there coins only?

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:44.780
(Posthouse)

00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:52.220
(Posthouse)

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:56.820
Xingyi,

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:59.280
urge our men to keep the secret.

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:01.300
We can't let Beishuo people know

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:02.360
who we really are.

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:04.160
If they can't find our sister,

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:07.040
I fear they'll have me replace her.

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:09.120
Yueling,

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:10.760
rest assured.

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:12.420
Those men

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:14.300
are the loyal guards of our family.

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:15.620
They take orders from me.

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:16.460
From now on,

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:18.740
you're Yueling, the maid,

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:20.160
and I'm Xingyi, the guard.

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:28.980
Your Grace,

00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:30.500
there you go.

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:33.400
You may wait,

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:35.560
but your injured brother...

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:40.220
(Posthouse)

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:45.700
Last night, the assassination failed.

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:47.520
Princess Zhu's maid died for her.

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:50.180
Blessed by God, Princess Ashina Zhu

00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:51.600
finally survived.

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:54.980
You guys must protect Her Grace more carefully.

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:55.820
- We will!
- We will!

00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:57.780
Lin Mu,

00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:59.100
arranged more guards

00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:00.220
to protect Xingyi.

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:01.060
All right.

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:03.420
We've communicated many times,

00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:05.000
but I still don't know your name.

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:06.240
Call me Wen Yu.

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:08.380
Mr. Wen Yu,

00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:09.860
you have great martial arts.

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:12.320
Stay beside my carriage at my service.

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:15.520
(You take yourself as a real princess, humph?)

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:18.280
(No one has dared
to order me about like a foot soldier.)

00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:20.200
(Why do you stare at me?)

00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:22.340
(Do think a fake princess like me)

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:23.640
(can't order you about?)

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:31.620
Let's move.

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:00.690
We sent assassins to the posthouse,

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:01.780
but none of them came back alive.

00:30:01.810 --> 00:30:03.060
The marriage escort went on their way.

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:04.980
Well, this time, let's kill them.

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:05.820
All right.

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:09.660
(Wedding)

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:33.720
Yueling.

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:42.700
Xingyi!

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:44.600
Yueling.

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:47.320
Danger!

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:54.080
Xingyi!

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:56.100
Halt!

00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:57.180
Halt!

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:01.620
There's an ambush in the forest ahead.

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:02.560
Let's take another route.

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:07.080
How do you know?

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:09.900
You had the same dream again.

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:11.840
So, you know about the ambush in the forest.

00:32:12.140 --> 00:32:13.560
Maybe it's not a dream.

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:16.000
Maybe it's what really happened.

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:18.480
What do you mean?

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:20.200
Just now,

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:22.080
we died together, huh?

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:24.680
Perhaps, we're back to life now.

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:29.680
Back to life?

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:22.460
Wen Yu.

00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:44.980
No!

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:49.980
Halt!

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:54.720
- Take another route.
- Take another route.

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:57.700
Your Highness,

00:33:58.060 --> 00:33:59.160
I have some confusion.

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:00.780
How do you know

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:02.560
there are ambushes on both routes

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:04.480
and insist on taking the third route?

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:06.500
It's a mystery.

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:07.480
I can hardly explain.

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:09.560
Mystery?

00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:18.320
(Again?)

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:20.140
Looks like the assassins

00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:21.540
have laid an ambush on every route

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:22.700
to Beishuo.

00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:24.280
Since you know it, die here.

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:27.000
Halt!

00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:34.660
Gentlemen,

00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:35.880
is it possible

00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:37.300
that you don't need to kill us

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:38.480
and we can kill ourselves?

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:39.760
For example,

00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:40.900
use the poison.

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:45.540
Now that you have a death wish,

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:46.760
I can make your dream come true.

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:48.260
This is the Seven-step Poison.

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:49.480
What is she doing?

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:51.040
Thanks. Thanks.

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:55.580
We can come back to life anyway.

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:56.920
Maybe we'll find a solution.

00:34:58.500 --> 00:34:59.960
I'll drink it up first.

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:08.380
Hurry.

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:11.240
Stop hesitating.

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:17.100
Here we go.

00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:23.000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:25.400
Umm...

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:34.240
We're back to life again.

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:38.200
Maybe with this jade pendant,
we can come back to life many times.

00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:40.580
But if we can't break out of this,

00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:42.280
we'll have to die here sooner or later.

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:44.140
But all the routes to Beishuo

00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:45.400
are guarded by the assassins.

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:47.520
How can we break out?

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:49.400
