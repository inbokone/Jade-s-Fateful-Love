I'll burn anyone you want.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.500

According to the North Prince,

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.570
you died after the failed treatment.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.010
I was worried for a long time.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.220
I was stabbed and I was dying.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.500
But His Highness paid
a lot of money for a famous doctor

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.340
who saved my life.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:09.810
Can he really be so helpful?

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.730
You said, "The North Prince is righteous

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:13.730
and handsome.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.690
Everybody likes him.

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.170
You want to see him

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.900
and you adore him."

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.850
But now, you suspect of his kindness?

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.900
I used that trick

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.780
just to get some information about you.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.580
The North Prince is lecherous.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.850
How could he be a nice guy?

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.530
What you see is what he appears to be like.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.220
You haven't really known him.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:38.820
The North Prince

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.610
is not only lecherous,

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.530
but also treasonous.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.260
Treasonous?

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.460
It records the evidence of his sins.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.020
Where did you get this account book?

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.940
Did anyone else see it?

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.860
Mr. Zhang, who works for the North Prince,

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.540
traded this book in the House of Romance

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.100
and I stole it.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.020
This is my amulet.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.900
How come it's your amulet?

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.060
If the North Prince wants to hurt me

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.220
after he marries me,

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.860
showing this account book

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.260
will allow me to leave safely.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.700
Sounds feasible, Yueling.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.260
But this account book may get you killed.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.940
I'm afraid this mansion is no longer safe.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.060
Why is it no longer safe?

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.780
I guess someone is watching over you.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:40.620
You think you can

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.420
so easily keep this account book?

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.500
What... What do I do?

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.260
Do you have any idea?

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:48.800
You go to the North Prince's mansion.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.540
Go there?

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.660
When you're there,

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.580
the North Prince will protect you.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.980
You keep this account book, after all.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.260
Besides, if you're in trouble,

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.860
we can struggle together.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.180
It makes sense.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.620
(Pleasant and Harmonious)

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.900
Your Highness,

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.500
you insisted on going out
in the middle of the night.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.460
Your wound isn't deep.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.500
But you still need to recuperate.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.980
You lost the account book.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.060
With you guys around,

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.860
how can I possibly recuperate?

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.540
Sorry, Your Highness.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.380
We didn't expect her to steal

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.500
the account book
we deliberately gave Mr. Zhang.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:32.420
Your Highness,

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.680
will it affect our plan?

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.670
If the plan fails, we can think of another one.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.220
So, you asked her to move in ahead of time

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.150
just to protect her?

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.100
I can't stop worrying

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:51.820
until she and her brother

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.300
live around me.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.980
Looks like we have to go
to the North Prince's mansion.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.260
We don't know about that prince.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.380
What if he offends you,

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.460
Your Grace?

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.660
If he dares to offend my sister,

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.380
I'll kill him immediately.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.220
With this,

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.620
(Account Book)
I don't think he dares to offend me.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.420
If the North Prince rebels,

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.300
his consort

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.420
will also be held accountable.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.740
Your Grace, will you really marry him?

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:39.340
(Account Book)

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.420
If I don't marry him,

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.740
Beishuo will break our alliance

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.340
and destroy our state.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.060
By then, none of our people

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.540
can live a good life.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.380
What's worse,

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.980
my eldest sister will be caught.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.140
Then you'll be the sinner

00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.940
of Dongyu.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:03.100
So will you, Your Highness.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:06.460
Don't worry.

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.380
With this,

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.820
he won't dare to hurt us.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.420
If he dares to offend you,

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:14.620
we'll hand over the account book

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.140
and report him to the Emperor of Beishuo.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:16.980
That's right.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.260
So,

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:22.740
we'll have to go there.

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.140
(Account Book)
Let's just go.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:28.140
(The North Prince's Mansion)

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.380
Such a big mansion.

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.900
The North Prince is rich.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:44.540
The yard is carefully cleaned.

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:46.500
If he's a better man,

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.260
I'll allow Yueling to marry him.

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:49.900
Your Highness,

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.700
you said something different last night.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:53.420
I did?

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.340
You're always chatty.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.780
(Benign and Benevolent)

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.340
Yueling, this room is so big.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:32.020
Your Grace, what's wrong?

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.660
This room looks beautiful.

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.620
I'm just a little bit homesick.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:40.780
Your Grace, if you want to leave,

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:41.900
I'll always be with you.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:43.500
Yueling, I hear

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.100
the North Prince lives in the western yard

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.340
and he gives you the whole eastern yard.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.580
So, he doesn't want you to see him.

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.660
He doesn't want to see me?

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:53.540
I don't want to see him, either.

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.780
Let's just take whatever comes.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.460
Since we're given such a good place,

00:09:58.460 --> 00:09:59.980
let's just enjoy it.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.060
(Memorial to the Throne)
In this case,

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:06.420
I'll leave the mining thing

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:07.740
to the two of you.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.620
Rest assured, Your Highness.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.860
(Stay Modest)

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:21.980
Your Highness.

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:22.940
What?

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.180
Is everything ready for my consort?

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:26.380
Don't worry, Your Highness.

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.780
Princess Yueling has
settled down in the eastern yard.

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:30.580
They're satisfied with their place.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.340
Your effort for her isn't wasted.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:34.180
Good.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:38.180
Give her two cooks
who can make Dongyu dishes.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.140
She love those dishes.

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:39.980
Yes.

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:45.140
Anything else?

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.220
I just think

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.860
Your Highness cares really a lot

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.140
about Princess Yueling.

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:54.700
Thanks to you

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.620
who lost my account book of illegal mining.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:02.740
Your Highness,

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:05.420
Princess Yueling thinks highly of Wen Yu.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.780
So, you want to trick her of it

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.300
with Wen Yu's identity, huh?

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.540
Oh, not trick her.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:16.660
You will

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:18.140
just get it from her.

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.420
My maid Yueling

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.620
received a lot of help
from Wen Yu on her way here.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:41.940
So, she adores him.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.660
Yesterday, she accidentally heard

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.460
Wen Yu was assassinated
in the House of Romance

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.060
and she was really worried.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.620
I'm so glad that you're still alive.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:04.540
You sound so anxious.

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:07.620
I think you actually adore him

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.500
instead of Miss Yueling.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.260
Your Grace,

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:03.540
Butler Wen is here.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:05.660
Butler Wen.

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:09.900
Why did he come so early?

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.260
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:15.500
Your Highness ordered me

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:16.900
to take good care of you

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.420
and offer you all the best things.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:22.060
So, I picked the four of them

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:23.180
to serve you.

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:24.740
Come and meet Her Highness.

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.020
Greetings, Your Highness. I'm Rubing.

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.540
I'm good at makeup and hairstyles.

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:30.460
Greetings, Your Highness. I'm Rushuang.

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:31.940
I'm good at cleaning.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.740
Greetings, Your Highness. I'm Dali.

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:37.100
I'm good at making Beishuo and Dongyu dishes.

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.220
Greetings, Your Highness. I'm Daqi.

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:41.380
I'm good at making Beishuo and Dongyu pastry.

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:46.100
(What is the North Prince up to?)

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:48.700
Your Highness, His Highness said

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:50.940
you could ask for anything you wanted.

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.020
From this day on, the four of them
will work for you.

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.380
It's really nice of His Highness.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:03.220
His Highness also said

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:05.220
(Indenture)
you can keep half of their indentures.

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.740
Use them without worry.

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.980
It's quite thoughtful of him.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:11.380
Thank you, Butler Wen.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:13.020
Your Highness, since they're here,

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.340
I'll take my leave.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.180
In this case,

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:21.780
with Rubing, Rushuang,

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:22.820
Dali, and Daqi

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:24.300
joining us,

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.050
we've grown bigger.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.120
Oh,

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.620
how about we have a welcome dinner

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:33.100
of Dongyu style right tonight?

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.260
Why not?

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:35.100
Really?

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:37.780
Don't be shy.

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.060
We're a family now.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:41.700
There aren't too many rules in our state.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:42.860
You two look so strong.

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:57.740
Hurry.

00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:59.220
Bring that thing here.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:00.580
- All right.
- And that one.

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:01.460
Rubing and Rushuang,

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:02.500
hurry up.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:03.340
Come on. Hurry.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.440
The food is done.

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:06.180
- It'll smell great with some spice.
- All right.

00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:07.540
This dish is done, too.

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:08.700
Daqi, I want some super spice food.

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:09.620
Wait a minute. You'll have it.

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:11.020
Daqi, give me some.

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:12.340
You'll all have some.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:14.540
Daqi, give me one.

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:16.680
Come on, just one.

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:18.260
It's for Her Highness.
You'll all have some later.

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:19.420
Slow down.

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:20.460
- It's for all of you.
- Got it.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:21.980
- All right.
- Wait a minute.

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:23.100
- Give it to me.
- Here.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:24.300
Come on. All of you can have some.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:25.260
Yueling, taste it.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:30.780
It looks delicious.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:34.060
I'll take it there.

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:35.420
Put it over there.

00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:36.260
All right.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:38.860
Your Highness.

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:42.900
Nie Chen,

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:44.420
do you smell something?

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.300
(Nie Chen, the North Prince’s dark guard)
Smells like the roast meat.

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:50.460
Your Highness.

00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.340
Bad news, Your Highness.

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:53.190
What?

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.980
Her Grace is hold a big dinner in her yard.

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.220
The smell goes everywhere.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:58.940
The ladies all went there
to see the roast meat.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.420
Everything is in a mess.

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:03.940
- In a mess?
- Her Grace is roasting meat?

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:05.380
Am I hearing this right?

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:06.820
Yes, Your Highness.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:09.180
We've never seen it before.

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:11.380
Your Highness, go take a look.

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:16.140
Everybody, come on.

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:18.380
Let's drink together.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:19.260
Come on.

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:22.460
Cheers.

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:25.340
Come on.

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:31.500
All right.

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:44.340
Wen Yu.

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:46.740
Wen Yu.

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:08.140
Your Highness.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.500
Your Highness?

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.740
Nonsense.

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:20.100
This is Wen Yu, my good buddy.

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:21.260
There you are, at last.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:22.820
Let's go have a drink.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.860
Xingyi, Wen Yu is my good buddy.

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:28.700
- Fill his cup.
- Here.

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:29.980
Cheers.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:31.540
Fill his cup.

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:33.220
Good buddy,

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:36.140
we'll help each other
and never leave each other.

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:37.420
Cheers.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:41.500
You're drunk.

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:45.460
Am I drunk?

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:46.900
I don't know.

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:49.940
Am I drunk?

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:51.020
- No.
- You're not.

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:53.340
Her Grace won't be drunk.

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:54.700
See?

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:56.180
I told you.

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.540
I never get drunk.

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:11.860
Why do I see three copies of you?

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:14.020
One.

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:17.820
Two.

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:19.900
Three.

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:29.180
What is happening to Her Highness?

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:32.740
Come on. Let's drink.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:13.340

We...

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.700
What is going on here?

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:49.740
His Highness married you to me.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.060
We've been married for three days.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:53.780
Why are you still not used to it?

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.540
We... We're married?

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.900
You told His Highness you adored me.

00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:03.580
Why do you not remember?

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:08.020
Be careful, honey.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:42.060
Your Grace, time to get up.

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:43.500
Your Grace.

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:58.660
Luckily, it was just a dream.

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:02.660
Why would I dream about Wen Yu?

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.940
Your Grace, who did you dream about?

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.410
Get up and get changed.

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:09.260
Nobody.

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:12.420
Qianqian,

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:13.980
last night,

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:15.950
how did I come back to my room?

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:20.980
Your Grace, I was also drunk last night.

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:23.420
When I woke up, you were asleep in the room.

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:24.660
Besides,

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:26.980
you can drink more than I do.

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:32.100
But...

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:35.820
Did I come back by myself?

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:52.940
Wen Yu,

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:55.100
it's so nice of you.

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:03.620
I flirted with Wen Yu.

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:08.500
No wonder I had that kind of dream.

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:11.740
Your Grace, did you have a nightmare?

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:14.340
Never mind. A dream is always opposite.

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:22.860
Indeed, a dream is always opposite.

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:24.900
(Pleasant and Harmonious)

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:27.580
Your Highness, Her Highness has moved in.

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:28.960
Will you still visit the House of Pretties?

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.260
Isn't it inappropriate?

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:33.420
Now, Yueling lives here.

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:35.100
It may be dangerous to keep those ladies.

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:36.100
I should go meet them.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:37.300
You're right.

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:39.580
I think Her Highness will understand.

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:41.220
There you go.

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:42.380
Yes.

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:48.540
Your Grace, you...

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:49.500
I'm moving back.

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:51.790
(Gao Luoyi, Commandery Princess of Beishuo)
I'm going to greet my cousin.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:52.860
Welcome back, Your Grace.

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:55.260
But you had a long trip.

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:56.740
How about you get back for some rest?

00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:58.020
Where is my cousin?

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:01.860
His Highness is in the middle of something.

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.300
Is he in the House of Pretties?

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:06.740
I'm here with an imperial decree.

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:08.580
I must see him now.

00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:11.220
- But...
- Do you want him to disobey the decree?

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:12.940
But...

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:14.860
Hey, Your Grace.

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:33.700
Shiyu.

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:36.260
- Your Highness.
- Shiyu.

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:41.660
You cheap woman.

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.420
How dare you sit on my cousin's laps?

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:45.060
Get out of here.

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:47.340
Luoyi, what are you doing?

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:49.940
When I was away from this house,

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:51.180
women like you

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:52.580
became cubbish, huh?

00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:54.220
Your Highness, that's not true.

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:55.600
- We aren't.
- Your Highness, we aren't cubbish.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:56.540
- Your Highness.
- Yeah.

00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:59.260
Shiyu, I hate it when they seduce you.

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:01.420
You... Get out of here!

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:03.700
All right. Leave us.

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:07.180
Humph.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.340
Aren't you supposed to accompany
the Great Consort in the palace?

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:16.300
What are you doing here?

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:19.100
Knowing you're going to marry someone,

00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.960
I'm here to greet her.

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:22.820
And...

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:24.340
You won't be living here again, will you?

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:26.260
I will, of course.

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.060
I'm here under the command
of the Great Consort.

00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:30.380
You must not kick me out.

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:32.300
I hear

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:34.940
Her Highness and her servants
got drunk last night.

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:36.740
The scandal even made its way to the palace.

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:40.780
I'm here to give her a present.

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:43.340
Present?

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:54.300
Where is Xingyi?

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:57.740
His Highness has gone to the House of Romance

00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:00.050
for the assassin, I think.

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:06.460
Your Highness,

00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:08.620
this is the western yard.

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.180
It's where His Highness lives.

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:11.820
You can't get in without permission.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:13.340
Why?

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:14.580
Our princess

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:16.700
will be the North Princess Consort.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:17.740
Why can't she walk around?

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.020
You must not break in.

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:24.220
Who are you?

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:26.420
Her Highness is the North Princess Consort.

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:28.620
Just because of this,

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:29.900
I have to stop you.

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:33.340
Your Highness, this is
Madam Dong from the palace.

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:35.060
She was assigned by the Great Consort

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:36.780
to teach you Beishuo etiquette.

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:40.300
What? Teach me etiquette?

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:43.060
What etiquette?

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:46.060
(The House of Romance)

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:47.500
See you.

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:50.980
Gentleman, come in, please.

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:52.900
Who do you...?

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.220
Have Miss Su Nian come out and see me.

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:56.700
I'm sorry.

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:58.780
Miss Su Nian has a day off.

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:01.540
How about some other girls?

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:08.100
Su Nian is having a day off.

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:09.740
But if you insist on seeing her,

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:11.740
you can see her.

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:08.940
Su Nian.

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:15.220
You must give this guest

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:17.300
a great time today.

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:18.260
Get it?

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:20.420
Yes.

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:29.100
Still laughing?

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:31.420
It's not when

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:33.220
you dumped me off the horse, huh?

00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:37.540
You're so good at acting.

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:41.100
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:43.340
You'll know soon.

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:47.780
Gentleman, what would you like for today,

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:49.540
a song or a dance?

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:50.700
Martial contest.

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:53.660
Assassin, we're here alone.

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:55.300
Stop acting. Bring it on!

00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:59.460
It's so humorous of you.

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:01.300
But I can only dance

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:02.900
instead of doing martial arts.

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:37.420
What?

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:41.500
Gentleman, what do you think of this dance?

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:48.500
No...

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:49.780
Not that good.

00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:04.340
(Do I really get the wrong girl?)

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:08.020
(Looks like she isn't)

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:09.500
(the assassin.)

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:40.700
Stop.

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:42.140
One more time.

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:50.420
Stop.

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:53.100
Stand properly.

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:54.900
You should behave elegantly.

00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:56.460
Put your hands before you.

00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:00.460
Relax your shoulders and stay straight-backed.

00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:04.420
Head up.

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:09.380
This is the way
I've been standing for a dozen years.

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:10.580
I don't think anything is wrong with it.

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:12.260
Because you Dongyu people are impolite.

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:13.860
You have no manners.

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:16.340
Can politeness be food

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:17.660
or be clothes?

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:20.260
I think I'll just stop learning this.

00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:21.100
You...

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:23.820
You're being ridiculous.

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:26.820
I used to teach the imperial consorts only.

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:28.820
No one dared to reject my instruction.

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.980
Your Highness, stand straight up.

00:32:31.820 --> 00:32:34.220
Because you didn't meet me before.

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:36.380
I'm not an obedient Beishuo girl.

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:38.100
- That's right.
- You...

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:41.340
So, this is the rumored
Eldest Princess of Dongyu?

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:44.900
I hear my cousin-in-law
is the most virtuous lady in Dongyu

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:46.380
and she is really elegant.

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:48.780
What? You can't even walk properly?

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:50.180
Who are you?

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:54.380
Princess Luoyi is the sister
of Lord of the South

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.780
and the cousin of the North Prince
he favors most.

00:32:57.940 --> 00:32:59.900
Did Her Highness even talk to you?

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:01.180
Why did you interrupt?

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:03.260
Qianqian, fall back.

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:04.780
They have no manners,

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:06.180
but we need some.

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:09.260
Princess Luoyi, you sound so sarcastic.

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:12.220
You seem to impolite, too.

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:14.140
- I...
- Well, I'm generous enough.

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:16.660
How about Madam Dong gives you some lessons?

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:19.860
You... You're impolite

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:21.140
and you have no manners.

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:23.300
You disgraced my cousin that much

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:24.860
and even the imperial family heard about it.

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:27.260
However poorly I behave,

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:28.940
I am your cousin-in-law.

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:30.700
You're in no position to judge me.

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:32.620
I should show

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:33.620
your caring cousin

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:35.540
how sarcastic you are

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:36.660
and see what he'll comment.

00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:38.540
- You...
- Good point, Your Highness.

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:40.140
- Good.
- I dare you!

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:41.780
Let's wait and see.

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:43.180
See if I dare.

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:45.100
- Qianqian.
- Here.

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:46.020
See them out.

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:46.860
Yes.

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.820
(Huilan Pavilion)
To be the North Princess Consort,

00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:58.220
I have to learn so many things.

00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:00.580
Why are there so many rules in Beishuo?

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:13.180
(Huilan Pavilion)

00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:30.940
How I miss my hometown.

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:36.740
(Huilan Pavilion)

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:40.180
What's on your mind?

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:42.820
You freaked me out.

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:44.540
What are you doing here?

00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:48.660
I heard you were learning etiquette lately.

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:49.860
How do you feel?

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:52.620
I don't think I'm fit for this state.

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:56.100
Why?

00:34:57.060 --> 00:34:59.460
Madam Dong used to serve the Empress.

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:01.420
You can learn a lot from her.

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:06.980
It's really hard to learn your local manners.

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:10.380
I love my state.

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:12.820
We live a free and equal life there.

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:20.180
You're homesick?

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:42.060
The ladies we dispatched
to the North Prince's mansion

00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:43.420
have been expelled.

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:51.620
Another calligraphy is ruined.

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:55.860
What a loser!

00:35:57.740 --> 00:35:59.520
The North Prince's mansion
is more heavily guarded.

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:00.660
Our men

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:02.100
can no longer sneak in.

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:04.540
You can't even sneak

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:05.860
into a mere prince's mansion.

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:07.340
Don't be angry, Prime Minister.

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:09.380
I've arranged everything.

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:11.980
It's all under deployment.

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:22.860
Looks like

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:26.220
Zhou Shiyu won't hide anymore.

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:03.540
Who's there?

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:12.100
Lingxi?

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:14.500
(Lingxi, the assassin of the Roufeng Sect)
Su Nian, you still remember me.

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:16.380
It's been years.

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:19.540
You look more gorgeous, Su Nian.

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:22.460
No wonder rich young guys in the Capital City

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:25.220
spent money like water just to see you.

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:28.500
How have you been these years?

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:33.220
I've been doing dirty missions.

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:36.860
I naturally don't live a great life

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:40.140
as you do in the House of Romance.

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:43.860
I have to flatter people here.

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:45.980
My life isn't that great.

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:52.940
Master sent me here

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:55.940
to assist you in your new mission.

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:57.220
Assist me?

00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:00.500
Master is angry because you failed last time.

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:02.740
But he's giving you a second chance.

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:14.260
(It's her.)

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:17.460
She came here before

00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:19.980
and stole the account book Master wanted.

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:22.700
Our mission

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.500
is to find her and get the book back.

00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:27.240
I'm grateful for Master's not discarding me.

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:28.900
I'll complete this mission.

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:40.820
Rushuang, let me help you.

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:42.700
Your Grace, it's weird.

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:44.700
Madam Dong used to come very early.

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:45.740
But now, it's late in the morning.

00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:46.860
She still hasn't come.

00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:52.980
I wish she would never come again.

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:54.380
Her manners

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:56.820
are nearly crushing me.

00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:00.820
Your Grace, why is Mr. Lin here?

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:05.340
Greetings, Your Highness.

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:07.180
Why is it you?

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:08.260
Why can't it be me?

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:09.700
Your Highness,

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:11.580
His Highness sent me here for a message.

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:13.300
Since you've learned a lot,

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:15.180
Madam Dong has returned to the palace.

00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:19.580
Does it mean

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:22.140
I no longer need to learn anything?

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:23.520
That's right, Your Highness.

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:30.540
Why?

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:32.060
His Highness gave the order.

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:35.140
I guess he cares for you, Your Highness.

00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:38.140
I can't ask too much about the other stuff.

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:40.740
All right. I get it.

00:39:40.740 --> 00:39:42.260
I'll take my leave, then.

00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:58.580
I no longer need to learn anything!
