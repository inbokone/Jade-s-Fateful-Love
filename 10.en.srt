19
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,480
Your Grace, what are you thinking?

20
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,480
On the painting day,
someone must have sneaked in

21
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,330
and stolen the account book.

22
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,920
Account book?

23
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,850
No wonder he said he would leave in advance.

24
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,890
That was just an excuse.

25
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:17,240
Actually, he didn't leave.

26
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,290
He sneaked in and stole the account book.

27
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,200
That day, we had Mr. Siyuan,

28
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,520
Miss Su Nian,

29
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,130
Miss Lingxi,

30
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,600
- and...
- The South Prince.

31
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,800
It must be him, the evil guy.

32
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,170
I won't let him get in here again.

33
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,480
The... The South Prince?

34
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,330
Brother, I'm innocent!

35
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,130
Brother, if you don't come to see me,

36
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,360
I'll have to kill myself for innocence.

37
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,360
Your Majesty, it's the South Prince.

38
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,480
Your Highness,

39
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,480
- don't do this.
- Don't touch me.

40
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,960
- Your Highness.
- Don't get me up.

41
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,010
Stay off. Let me die.

42
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,960
- His Highness hasn't recovered.
- Brother, come out and see me.

43
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,730
What is he doing here?

44
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,450
Brother.

45
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,960
Get him in.

46
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,450
Yes.

47
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,050
Greetings, Brother.

48
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:41,890
There's no need of that here.

49
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,410
You're injured.

50
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:44,890
You can be seated.

51
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,170
My... my hips.

52
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,730
I'd rather not sit.

53
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:55,080
Zhixuan, you're here even before you recover.

54
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,850
What on earth do you want?

55
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,800
I just don't understand.

56
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,760
Zhou Shiyu's crime must be

57
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,200
more serious than mine, right?

58
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,450
Brother, why did you punish him so little?

59
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,360
So, you think I'm unfair?

60
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,410
I dare not.

61
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,170
I know

62
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,050
I'm the concubine's son

63
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,210
while Shiyu is the lineal son.

64
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,970
But I think you should punish him impartially.

65
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,850
We shouldn't be punished the same way.

66
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:23,970
Otherwise,

67
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,290
I'll have to...

68
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,010
Your Majesty!

69
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,720
I'm fine.

70
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:44,610
I...

71
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,000
I didn't mean to offend you, Brother.

72
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,010
Zhixuan,

73
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,880
I actually care the same

74
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,530
for you and Shiyu.

75
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,210
You're like my arms.

76
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,680
Even if you make mistakes,

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,320
how do I have the nerve to break my arms?

78
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,640
Brother,

79
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,880
do you really not think less of me

80
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,880
because I'm the concubine's son?

81
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,730
I don't, of course.

82
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,560
Whatever Shiyu has,

83
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,480
you always have it, too.

84
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,050
That's because I am...

85
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,320
As good as Zhou Shiyu.

86
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,240
But in this case,

87
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,170
Zhou Shiyu made a more serious mistake.

88
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,290
Brother, if you don't change your mind,

89
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,530
I'm not leaving.

90
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,450
Even if I can't remonstrate with my life,

91
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,770
I'll keep remonstrating every day.

92
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,560
Then I'll have Shiyu
go to Liuzhou for disaster relief.

93
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,850
He'll atone for his crime.

94
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,610
What do you think, Zhixuan?

95
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,360
That's more like it.

96
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,410
Your Highness, you look much happier.

97
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,610
Did you make it?

98
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,920
Oh, Your Highness.

99
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:47,560
Xu,

100
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,090
I should give you a big reward.

101
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,170
Zhou Shiyu is expelled to Liuzhou.

102
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,120
Go tell the chefs

103
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,970
to make more dishes for dinner.

104
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,730
Tonight, I'll celebrate it.

105
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,210
Liuzhou?

106
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,800
Your Grace, is anything bothering you?

107
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,770
Mr. Perfect, you're hyper-informed.

108
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,050
Do you know where I can buy
the Boost Healing Powder?

109
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:38,800
The Boost Healing Powder?

110
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,240
Some special powder from Dongyu.

111
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,680
It perfectly heals the wounds.

112
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,050
Your Grace, are you wounded?

113
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,850
Not me.

114
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,090
But a friend of mine.

115
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,410
If it's something special from Dongyu,

116
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,440
I guess it's only available on the West Market.

117
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,360
The West Market?

118
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,680
Su Nian, that silly prince is here again.

119
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,410
Tell him I'm sick

120
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:09,560
and I'm not seeing anyone today.

121
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,770
You won't see him?

122
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,920
We don't have a new mission, anyway.

123
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,610
It's quite fun to tease him.

124
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:18,240
We got the account book.

125
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:19,920
There's no need to practice martial arts.

126
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,050
Su Nian, have you picked a weapon?

127
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,290
There he is.

128
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,170
Su Nian, have you picked a weapon?

129
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,030
Next,

130
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,490
I'll teach you how to use a weapon.

131
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,680
No need.

132
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,560
So, you've picked a weapon you want.

133
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,960
Show me what you picked.

134
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,220
(A Record of Miscellaneous Performing Arts)

135
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,960
I mean I'm not going to learn martial arts.

136
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,130
You are not?

137
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,890
Why?

138
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,770
Mr. Xingyi,

139
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,250
I really don't have a talent for martial arts.

140
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,560
Besides, you and I have
only known for a few days.

141
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,840
You don't need to bother like this.

142
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,680
You have no talent,

143
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,680
but you can practice hard.

144
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,890
Don't worry about it.

145
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,960
- I'll teach you.
- Mr. Xingyi.

146
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,640
I'm tired.

147
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,960
Do yourself a favor and leave.

148
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,520
Su Nian.

149
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,530
Su Nian, but...

150
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,700
(Pleasant and Harmonious)

151
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,770
Your Highness, did you see Her Highness?

152
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,680
Still hasn't come back?

153
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,250
You visited her three times.

154
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,200
Will you keep waiting?

155
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,010
No.

156
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,050
I have to leave before it gets dark.

157
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,200
How's the packing going?

158
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,560
It's done.

159
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,320
Your Highness, you always know.

160
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,440
His Majesty really sent you to Liuzhou

161
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,650
for the disaster relief.

162
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,370
Pack the ointment Yueling gave me.

163
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,250
That ointment isn't very effective.

164
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,650
I don't think it'll help a lot.

165
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,320
Why don't we take the miracle ointment

166
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,250
Princess Luoyi gave you?

167
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,560
Take the one from Yueling.

168
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,680
Fine.

169
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,180
(The West Market)

170
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,800
This is the West Market.

171
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,680
Fried Spicy Chicken. Shish kebab.

172
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,250
This place looks a little bit deserted.

173
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,560
Are you sure the powder is available here?

174
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,370
Fried Spicy Chicken. Shish kebab.

175
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,050
Delicious and loveable.

176
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,680
What do you want, sir?

177
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,050
Pick as you wish.

178
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,920
This is good medicine from Dongyu.

179
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,960
How about the Boost Healing Powder for wounds?

180
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,010
Sure.

181
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,080
Five taels of silver for one bottle.

182
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,600
Pay before you get it.

183
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,530
The set price for everyone.

184
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,320
This is the rule in the West Market.

185
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,890
Quite a weird rule.

186
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,510

Shiyu,

199
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,290
I bought you our special Boost Healing Powder.

200
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,320
Her Highness, you're back.

201
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,600
Where's His Highness?

202
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,080
His Highness has gone to Liuzhou.

Your Highness, before His Highness left,

205
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,250
he asked me to take your orders.

206
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,840
So, if you need anything, let me know.

207

tell me about it.

211
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,320
Make yourself comfortable and don't be shy.

212
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,530
All right. I'll keep it in mind.

213
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,200
Your Highness,

214
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,250

215
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,530

(The House of Breeze)

227
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,130
Your Grace,

228
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,560
the South Prince had an invitation sent.

229
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,130
The South Prince?

230
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,340
(Invitation)

231
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,440
Whose letter is it?

232
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,840
"Greetings, Your Grace.

233
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,490
I hear you love sheep and cows.

234
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,050
I have a very cute little pig.

235
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,800
It's quite adorable.

236
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,600
So, I'd like to invite you to see it."

237
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,650
The South Prince?

238
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,490
Pig?

239
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,720
This prince is so different.

240
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,250
He knew you loved sheep and cows,

241
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,600
but he still mentioned his pig.

242
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,490
I wonder how his pig may taste better,

243
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,560
roasted or stewed.

244
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,560
Stewed, I think.

245
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:30,850
I won't go.

246
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,010
He stole the account book.

247
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,050
- I'll go, then.
- No. No one can go.

248
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,100
(Benign and Benevolent)

249
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,600
(Shall I write him a letter?)

250
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:52,010
(But what can I write in the letter?)

251
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,530
Hey, Your Grace.

252
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:54,800
Bad news.

253
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,920
The Great Consort
will hold a feast for her juniors.

254
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,010
You're invited to the palace.

255
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,800
The palace carriage is waiting out there.

256
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,440
Butler Wen asked you to get dressed up and go.

257
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:04,800
To the palace?

258
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,300
(Benign and Benevolent)

259
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,170
Qianqian.

260
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,600
Do I look like my eldest sister?

261
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,720
Mostly, in terms of posture.

262
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,840
But in terms of tone,

263
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,490
you need to sound calmer.

264
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,680
Then, you'll look more like her.

265
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,130
All right.

266
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,680
Your dress looks great.

267
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,520
Yeah, doesn't it?

268
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,260
Look. That's the future North Princess Consort.

269
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,950
She's pretty.

270
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,080
Sadly, she's from Dongyu.

271
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,370
Yeah, indeed.

272
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,680
That's too bad.

273
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,050
The North Prince is charming, after all.

274
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,410
(What's the problem with Dongyu girls?)

275
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,440
(You think we want to be married here?)

276
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,960
If she wasn't a princess,

277
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,920
what kind of man would like her?

278
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,680
Oh, the Princess of Dongyu is also here.

279
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,010
Such a rare visitor.

280
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,250
Look at her.

281
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,530
Why is she so perky?

282
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,840
Your Grace, why do you not talk to anyone?

283
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,360
Do you look down on me

284
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,110
or do your people despise Beishuo people?

285
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,880
- Yeah.
- That's right.

286
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,640
Dongyu is a deserted small state.

287
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,800
How can she look down our state?

288
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,970
Yeah.

289
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,880
She's a mere princess for marriage.

290
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,010
How can she be so perky?

291
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,400
She doesn't even talk.

292
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:23,770
Dongyu isn't a deserted small state.

293
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,730
Like your state,

294
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,450
we have fortified cities,

295
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:28,640
vast lands,

296
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,840
simple people,

297
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,160
and strong troops.

298
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,880
You're shortsighted.

299
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,080
I won't bother with you, then.

300
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,970
But please get to know clearly

301
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,730
before you say anything

302
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,360
in case you make a fool of yourselves.

303
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,730
Who will actually laugh?

304
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,160
We're shortsighted,

305
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,400
but we won't marry our princess for peace.

306
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,730
- Yeah.
- That's right.

307
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,450
When you're out of Dongyu,

308
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,930
you don't know what kind of life you'll live.

309
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,050
- Yeah.
- That's right.

310
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,160
Don't be so perky.

311
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,290
- That's right.
- Let's ignore her.

312
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,210
(If there was another way out,)

313
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,490
(who would want to leave her hometown?)

314
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:08,290
Your Grace, the Great Consort
wants to talk to you.

315
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,290
Please come with me.

316
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:13,400
Why does Her Royal Highness want to see me?

317
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,080
Her Royal Highness always
cares about the North Prince,

318
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,290
so she wants to talk to you privately.

319
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:18,130
Come, please.

320
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,730
Why did Her Royal Highness invite her only?

321
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,840
Who cares?

322
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,160
It can't be anything good.

323
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:41,970
This way, Your Grace.

324
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,880
Why is this place so dark?

325
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:55,160
Why are you locking me up?

326
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,930
Don't go!

327
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,970
Anybody out there?

328
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,010
Her Royal Highness also
invited the Princess of Dongyu, huh?

329
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,120
Why isn't she here?

330
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,080
Your Highness,

331
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:08,560
Her Grace was summoned alone
by Her Royal Highness.

332
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,840
Now, she's gone there.

333
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:12,640
Zhou Zhixuan,

334
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,160
don't go too far.

335
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,530
She's the North Prince's wife.

336
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:16,800
What does she concern you?

337
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,640
Gao Luoyi,

338
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,160
don't bother who I care about.

339
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,160
You must be jealous.

340
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,800
Because I care about the Princess of Dongyu,

341
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,640
right?

342
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,880
I'm the Commandery Princess,

343
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,000
the cousin of His Majesty,

344
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:35,450
and the biological sister
of the Lord of the South.

345
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,290
Why would I be jealous

346
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:39,050
of a princess from a deserted state?

347
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,290
You're not jealous of her.

348
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,970
Then you must be admiring me.

349
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,050
Or why would you care so much

350
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,080
about who I care for?

351
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,560
Zhou Zhixuan,

352
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:52,080
you've always had an odd way of thinking.

353
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,970
But why are you even narcissistic
when you grow up?

354
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,160
How can I possibly admire you?

355
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,080
The one I admire

356
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,800
has to be Shiyu.

357
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:03,690
You've never been as good as him.

358
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,840
I wouldn't even give you a second look.

359
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,320
Shiyu, Shiyu.

360
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,490
He was expelled to Liuzhou.

361
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,730
You don't even know if he can come back alive.

362
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,690
Don't be so sarcastic.

363
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,930
You got him in this trouble.

364
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,970
Gao Luoyi.

365
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:22,490
- It's just you.
- The Great Consort is here.

366
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,050
Take your seats.

367
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:45,320
Why isn't the Princess of Dongyu here?

368
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,250
Sorry, Your Royal Highness.

369
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,880
Her Grace didn't feel very well

370
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,360
and she went back.

371
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,010
How impolite!

372
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,200
Forget it.

373
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,320
Let's get started.

374
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,690
(She didn't go see Her Royal Highness.)

375
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,490
(Weird.)

376
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:09,050
(If she's away,)

377
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,690
(I've come for nothing, then.)

378
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,490
Anybody out there?

379
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,210
Open the door!

380
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,160
Anybody out there?

381
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,400
Anybody?

382
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,930
(Zhou Shiyu, if only you were here!)

383
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:05,580
(Pleasant and Harmonious)

384
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,530
Come on, Linmu.

385
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,840
Her Grace has been in the palace
for much of the day.

386
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,840
Now, it's dark.

387
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,210
Why hasn’t she come back yet?

388
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,450
When you're just away
from Her Grace for half a day,

389
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:19,050
you've started to miss her.

390
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:21,880
When you get married,

391
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,600
you will be a wife

392
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,490
who sticks to her husband, huh?

393
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:30,360
I'm not going to get married.

394
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,800
Her Grace saved my life.

395
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,290
I'll stay with her all my life.

396
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,400
Marry someone around her

397
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,560
and the problem will be solved.

398
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:45,490
Don't waste your time arguing with me.

399
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,320
Send someone to the palace

400
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,120
and find out what Her Grace is doing.

401
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,970
All right.

402
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,290
I'm on it.

403
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,730
His Highness has some men in the palace.

404
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:54,930
You don't need to worry too much.

405
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,560
Hurry, then.

406
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,160
Go faster. Go.

407
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:18,880
There you are, Your Majesty.

408
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,640
I'll make you some tea.

409
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,290
Who are you?

410
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:24,450
What "Your Majesty"? I'm not the empress.

411
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,800
Come and greet Her Majesty.

412
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:31,320
- Greetings, Her Majesty.
- Greetings, Her Majesty.

413
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,160
Don't kneel to me.

414
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,120
I'm really not the empress.

415
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,970
You're not the empress.

416
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,320
Finally, you're sober.

417
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,800
You're the emperor.

418
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:44,160
The emperor is here to see us.

419
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:50,880
The emperor is here to see us.

420
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,640
- Long live Your Majesty.
- Long live Your Majesty.

421
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,290
I should go.

422
00:24:58,770 --> 00:24:59,770
You must not go.

423
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,970
You haven't seen what I prepared you.

424
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:06,290
- Come on.
- Let me go.

425
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:07,160
Let go of her.

426
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,930
I invited you over to see Piggy.

427
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,320
Why didn't you come?

428
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,210
Naughty.

429
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:35,080
Is it appropriate to say this now?

430
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,680
That's right.

431
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,010
Why do you not salute me?

432
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,320
Where are your manners?

433
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,250
Forget it.

434
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,640
Let go of her.

435
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,920
I won't.

436
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:56,970
You little poor thing,

437
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:58,730
how dare you disobey me?

438
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:00,840
Are you sure you won't let her go?

439
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,400
Yes.

440
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,930
I'm getting angry, then.

441
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,320
Don't blame me for being rude.

442
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,000
See?

443
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,600
Without a smart prince like me,

444
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,880
you wouldn't be saved, huh?

445
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,640
Yeah. Thanks.

446
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:42,770
That's all?

447
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,840
What else do you want?

448
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,120
You think it was easy to get you out, huh?

449
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:51,080
You're lucky enough

450
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:51,970
to have met me.

451
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,560
And I was smart enough

452
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,400
to hear something from Gao Luoyi.

453
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,530
Otherwise, you wouldn't know

454
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,800
how much longer you had to be locked up.

455
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,490
We're even, then.

456
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:02,080
What do you mean?

457
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,080
Fine, you saved me for this once.

458
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,450
Forget about the stealing thing

459
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:07,450
and I'll let you go.

460
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,840
Stealing?

461
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,050
You sound really weird.

462
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,530
I saved your life.

463
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,640
Instead of praising my courage,

464
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,010
you wronged me for stealing something.

465
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,840
Fine, fine.

466
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,690
Thank you, Your Highness.

467
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,530
I have nothing to pay for your kindness.

468
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:22,990
I'll visit you another day and thank you.

469
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:25,930
That's more like it.

470
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:35,400
Look how courageous I was.

471
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,160
I'm better than Zhou Shiyu, aren't I?

472
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,840
How about you break it off with him

473
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,120
and marry me instead?

474
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,450
Now, I'm kind of your lifesaver.

475
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:47,560
I'll barely allow you

476
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:51,400
to marry me in return.

477
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:54,530
That's too bad.

478
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,210
Zhou Shiyu didn't see

479
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,770
how I saved his girl today.

480
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:01,530
If he saw that, he would be annoyed.

481
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:05,290
Oh, right.

482
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,210
I should write a letter to him.

483
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:11,050
Wait for me.

484
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,880
(When I'm away,)

485
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,490
(is everything all right with you?)

486
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:34,780
♪I'll always be in love with you♪

487
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:41,870
♪Promising it'll last forever♪

488
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:45,750

♪To have joy for the rest of its life♪

♪Then I wake up from the dream

496
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,200
Your Highness,

497
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,160
a letter from the Capital City

498
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,400
was delivered to the posthouse swiftly.

499
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,140
(To Zhou Shiyu)
(Can it be from Yueling?)

500
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:37,490
Zhou Shiyu,

501
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:40,290
I, the courageous and charming prince,

502
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:42,800
and the Princess of Dongyu love each other now.

503
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:45,320
The other day, I saved her in the palace

504
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:49,250
by getting her out of the deserted palace
after she stayed there all night.

505
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,640
Since then, she's been in love with me

506
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,840
and I love her, too.

507
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:56,690
So, I'm writing to tell you this.

508
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,530
Hope you're wise enough

509
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:00,010
to get scared off

510
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,010
and give up soon.

511
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:04,560
Or you would be the first man in our family

512
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,770
to lose his engagement.

513
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,600
The deserted palace?

514
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:14,880
Nie Chen, send someone
back to the Capital City.

515
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,930
I need to know whatever happened to Yueling.

516
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,880
Yes. I'm on it.

517
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,690
Your Highness, the team is ready.

518
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:24,880
We can leave in a moment.

519
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:27,530
But Mr. Shi Xuan is unacclimatized.

520
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,970
He's resting at our last stop.

521
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,290
Don't we wait for him?

522
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,120
Liuzhou has been in disaster for a long time.

523
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:33,600
People there complain with discontent.

524
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,400
The situation is terrible.

525
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,530
No time can be wasted.

526
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,730
The Minister of Revenue is weak.

527
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,320
Let him travel behind us.

528
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,440
Yes.

529
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:52,160
When Zhou Shiyu reads the letter,

530
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,840
he'll be infuriated.

531
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,600
Am I right, Piggy?

532
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:58,530
Do you think Piggy

533
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,250
can understand His Highness?

534
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:01,730
His Highness keeps talking to it.

535
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,730
Look how much you've eaten.

536
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,460
Indeed,

537
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,690
Piggy behaves better in His Highness's hands.

538
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,450
- When you're in a good mood,
- Right, huh?

539
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,730
you also have a good appetite,

540
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:10,600
right?

541
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,950
- Your Highness.
- Good pig.

542
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,080
The North Prince has gone to Liuzhou.

543
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,160
Why do you not feel anxious?

544
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,250
What if he does something great
to atone for his crime?

545
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,690
Why would I be anxious?

546
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:27,320
Zhou Shiyu has gone there for hardships.

547
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,050
What does "atoning for crime" mean?

548
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,880
One has to commit a crime

549
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:32,360
before he can atone for it.

550
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,730
What great things can he do?

551
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,010
If he takes good care of the disaster relief

552
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:39,400
and returns successfully,

553
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:40,930
I'm afraid

554
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,930
he'll only be meritorious.

555
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,010
Are you saying

556
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,800
he'll steal my thunder again?

557
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,640
That's right, Your Highness.

558
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:52,880
But I've just got closer
to the Princess of Dongyu.

559
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,970
Xu, what do you think I should do?

560
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:58,730
Don't panic, Your Highness.

561
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:04,640
If the North Prince fails his duty

562
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,050
and can't return successfully,

563
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,480
he won't be meritorious.

564
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:08,600
I asked you

565
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,530
to tell the chefs to make some chicken soup
for His Highness. Did you?

566
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:11,900
- That's right.
- I did.

567
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,490
You care so much for His Highness.

568
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:15,370
Of course.

569
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:20,180
(Liuzhou)

570
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:31,640
Next.

571
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:40,050
Next.

572
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,400
Grandpa, wake up.

573
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,290
Wake up for some porridge.

574
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:05,320
Grandpa, what's wrong with you?

575
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:12,450
Grandpa.

576
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,970
Your Highness, this is
the Relief Service Center in Liuzhou.

577
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,640
Let's go have a look.

578
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,480
Yes.

579
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,970
Evil official, give us some food.

580
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,450
We want porridge instead of water.

581
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:03,880
- Yeah.
- That's right.

582
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,160
It's only the rice soup.

583
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,640
Why is there not even a single grain in it?

584
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,600
No rice in the soup.

585
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,560
What are you talking about?

586
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,240
You're so unruly!

587
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:12,240
How dare you gather and make trouble?

588
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:14,760
Somebody.

589
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,280
Come and catch

590
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,530
these two troublemakers!

591
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:18,410
- Yes.
- Stop.

592
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,850
Who are you, gentleman?

593
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,450
Why is there only rice soup?

594
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,720
You have no idea, sir.

595
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,760
These people

596
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,970
come for food with their families every day.

597
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:38,010
The government granary has been empty.

598
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:39,280
There's really...

599
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:41,120
There's really nothing I can do.

600
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,240
Nonsense, you evil official.

601
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,050
Terrible rice keepers like you

602
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:46,370
have emptied the granary.

603
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:48,170
That's right.

604
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:49,560
Life is good for you.

605
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,010
You have rice every day.

606
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:51,850
But we...

607
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,720
We can't even have any rice husks.

608
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,240
Stop slandering me.

609
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:57,450
Do you have a death wish, huh?

610
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,560
Do you...?

611
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,760
How daring!

612
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,680
How dare you be so rude to me?

613
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,720
Do you have a death wish?

614
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,280
I think you actually have a death wish.

615
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,400
Take him away.

616
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:15,410
- He's taken away.
- He's gone.

617
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:16,490
Rest assured, everybody.

618
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,010
I'll take care of this soon.

619
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:20,280
- This is great.
- This is great.

620
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:25,850
Linmu,

621
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:27,370
do you not have anything to do?

622
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:29,080
Why do you come here every day?

623
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,640
My job is to protect Her Highness.

624
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:33,370
Miss Qianqian, let me help you.

625
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:35,370
No need.

626
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:38,010
Then why do you always follow me?

627
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,450
Her Highness asked me

628
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:41,160
to take orders from you.

629
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,930
So, who else can I follow?

630
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:43,770
Shh.

631
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:45,760
Her Grace is writing something.

632
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,640
Keep your voice down.

633
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,280
Don't annoy me.

634
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:51,620
Shh.

635
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,850
Let me help you. Come on.

636
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:00,260
(The Boost Healing Powder)

637
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:03,760
(I wonder how Shiyu is doing now.)

638
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:06,280
(Has he totally recovered?)

639
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,120
Slow down.

640
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,440
Thank you.

641
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,050
Thank you so much.

642
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,120
Thanks.

643
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,600
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

644
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,480
Your Highness,

645
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:46,680
we found many official grains
in that grain keeper's house.

646
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,050
So, the people here told the truth.

647
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:51,120
Check all the grains

648
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,110
and make reasonable arrangements.

649
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:54,370
Make sure every refugee can get some porridge.

650
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:57,240
But more refugees are coming.

651
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,280
I'm afraid

652
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:00,160
the remaining food can't last long.

653
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:02,720
Send someone to get Shi Xuan here.

654
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,760
His grains can save lives.

655
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:06,080
Yes. I'm on it.

656
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,810
This is the place. Food is here.

657
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,120
I'll get some first.

658
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,050
Nobody shall fight for it.

659
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,520
Go, Nie Chen.

660
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:38,560
Come on, son.

661
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:43,330
Don't snatch my food.

662
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,530
Don't snatch it.

663
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,810
Be careful, Your Highness!

664
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:52,970
Someone's killing!

665
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,640
Someone's killing!

666
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,040
