Assassins!

22
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,610
Your Highness, what happened?

23
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:08,730
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

24
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,290
- I'm not dead.
- Are you all right, Your Highness?

25
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,130
I'm not dead.

26
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,080
What happened?

27
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:15,050
Your Highness, you had a nightmare again?

28
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,360
Yang Xu, Yang Xu.

29
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:18,920
At the Lantern Festival,

30
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,800
someone assassinated me.

31
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,800
Then I was killed.

32
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,640
Umm...

33
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,960
Your Highness, I was by your side that day.

34
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,080
Look, you're exactly alive.

35
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,240
I was dead.

36
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,200
- How come...?
- Dead.

37
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,170
Your Highness.

38
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,010
Are you bewitched or something, Your Highness?

39
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,330
Come on. Stop crying.

40
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,520
His Highness isn't dead.

41
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,520
Come on, Your Highness.

42
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,760
You... You're alive.

43
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,890
Don't scare yourself.

44
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,730
Am I really all right?

45
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,130
Look at your strong body.

46
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:53,170
It's pretty good.

47
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,450
But...

48
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,330
I still think I was killed.

49
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,130
Your Highness,

50
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,610
what do we do?

51
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,450
It's your fault.

52
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,890
You led to all this.

53
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,080
It's all your fault.

54
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,450
Don't cry, Your Highness. Come on.

55
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,730
Your Highness, hang in there.

56
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,240
This robe is indeed evil.

57
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,080
Pick it up.

58
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,290
Master, I was wearing this robe

59
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,240
when I was shot to death.

60
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:13,410
Master,

61
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,010
is His Highness really bewitched?

62
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,440
This robe is actually in good condition.

63
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,410
Oh, I see.

64
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,250
Give me my sword.

65
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,970
Master, save me.

66
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,530
Your Highness, don't say anything now.

67
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,800
Your Highness, the evilness is gone.

68
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,970
You can rest assured.

69
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,450
Really?

70
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,490
Yes.

71
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:12,650
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

72
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,210
I do feel...

73
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,730
- Better?
- Indeed.

74
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:17,570
I feel much better.

75
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,880
- Is that true?
- Really?

76
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,170
Master, you helped me get rid of the evilness.

77
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,240
I shall greatly reward you.

78
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,920
- Dongxue.
- Here.

79
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,440
Take him to the counting house for the reward.

80
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,650
- Yes.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

81
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,000
Master,

82
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,850
did we really get rid of the evilness?

83
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,360
I just calmed him down.

84
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,290
There's no such thing as evilness.

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,050
I'm such a survivor.

86
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,720
- The evilness haunted me.
- That's right.

87
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,690
But the Master helped me out.

88
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,650
I even survived
the assassination in the South Street.

89
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,280
Xu.

90
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,480
Don't forget to write a report to my brother.

91
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,800
I deserve the credit for this.

92
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,360
Don't let Zhou Shiyu steal my thunder.

93
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,200
Yes.

94
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,770
But Your Highness, don't you find it weird?

95
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,880
How did the North Prince know

96
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,410
about the assassination in the South Street?

97
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,050
Yeah.

98
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,920
Did he send the assassins?

99
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,680
It doesn't make sense.

100
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:15,970
If he sent the assassins,

101
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,120
why did he tell me about it?

102
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,210
Don't you think he has a problem

103
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,850
with the Princess of Dongyu?

104
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,360
It's so smart of you.

105
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,880
They do have a problem.

106
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,970
A problem with their relationship.

107
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:34,870
But...

108
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,440
Chunhua, Qiuyue, Xiachan.

109
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,410
- Here.
- Here.

110
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,120
You know best about women's hearts.

111
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,090
Teach me something.

112
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,560
I'll keep pursuing the princess.

113
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,880
- Count on us.
- Count on us.

114
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,360
- Let's go, Your Highness.
- Come on.

115
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,210
But Your Highness...

116
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,800
(It's so hard to work for you.)

117
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,530
Your Highness, you've been
carving the whole day.

118
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:33,600
Have some refreshments.

119
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,050
Leave them there.

120
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,400
Yes.

121
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,600
Prime Minister,

122
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,800
I...

123
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,840
I really don't understand.

124
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,370
Why...?

125
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,680
Why can Zhou Shiyu

126
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:32,890
know about all our plans in advance?

127
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,650
This time...

128
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,680
This time, I dispatched

129
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,600
my men of sacrifice.

130
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,170
There can't be an inside traitor.

131
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,650
Maybe we're guessing it wrong.

132
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,200
What is

133
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,720
Zhou Shiyu's secret?

134
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,540
(Hall of Politics)

135
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,560
Greetings, Brother.

136
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,210
Shiyu,

137
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,920
I heard the other day,

138
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,440
you, Chenyu, and the Princess of Dongyu

139
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,440
were assassinated.

140
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,890
What? Were you hurt?

141
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:30,770
Everything is fine.

142
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,650
I'm having a secret investigation on it,

143
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,650
but haven't found conclusive evidence yet.

144
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,440
Glad you're fine.

145
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,440
But Chenyu

146
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,010
was badly sick.

147
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,530
I sent an imperial physician.

148
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,680
Don't be too serious

149
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,170
in the game with Chenyu.

150
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,050
He's slow-witted.

151
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,530
I fear he'll take it seriously.

152
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,890
You'd better concede to him.

153
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,090
I will.

154
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,650
But I have one request.

155
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,960
Tell me about it.

156
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,890
I want you to issue a decree.

157
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,010
Your Majesty, it's done.

158
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,720
Today,

159
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,410
my youngest brother

160
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,200
requested a decree for the Princess of Dongyu.

161
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,280
Why?

162
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,250
It has never happened before.

163
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,080
Yeah.

164
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,130
Abnormal, indeed.

165
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,370
Will you really not talk to me?

166
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,680
That's not true.

167
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,720
How may I serve you, Your Highness?

168
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,490
I'm used to your calling me Wen Yu.

169
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,800
Or call me Shiyu.

170
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,680
All right,

171
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,370
Your Highness.

172
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,920
Still mad at me?

173
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,410
I'm the fake Eldest Princess

174
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,840
from Dongyu.

175
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,290
In Beishuo, I have no one to rely on.

176
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,530
Without Your Highness's support,

177
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:32,960
I can barely live.

178
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,680
How do I dare to be mad at you?

179
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,290
My brother gave you a Dongyu horse,

180
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,920
so we're going hunting.

181
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,960
How about we stop arguing today?

182
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,370
Later,

183
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,490
you can enjoy a thrill ride.

184
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:51,370
All right.

185
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,290
The crossbow is for you.

186
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,560
I'll teach you how to use it when hunting.

187
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:02,890
You can also use it for self-protection.

188
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,080
I think we should hunt separately.

189
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,680
I'm going out now.

190
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,010
(It seems to be made by hand.)

191
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,010
(He actually made it with care.)

192
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,330
Su Nian,

193
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,800
I've invited that silly prince to come over.

194
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,320
Is everything ready out there?

195
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,200
Don't worry.

196
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:13,650
The instrument is put out there.

197
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,370
Everything is ready.

198
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,200
You're always gorgeous.

199
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:23,840
When you use the lipstick
that is recently popular in the Capital City,

200
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,370
you look even prettier.

201
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,840
Later,

202
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,650
you'll certainly fascinate that nerd.

203
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,750
(The House of Romance)

204
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:44,770
Miss Su Nian,

205
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,800
where did you buy this lipstick?

206
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,960
My wife asked me many times.

207
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,410
I always want to buy one for her.

208
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,840
It looks so pretty.

209
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:55,890
You...

210
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,600
Xingyi?

211
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,890
Why did you punch me?

212
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,080
What is your problem?

213
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,650
You tried to touch her.

214
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,010
I should punch you.

215
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,770
Such a lunatic.

216
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:12,200
I won't bother to argue.

217
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,170
Leave quickly.

218
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,160
Or I'll punch you again.

219
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,280
Are you all right?

220
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:22,130
Actually, he was just...

221
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:22,970
I know.

222
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,440
I've seen a lot of guys like him.

223
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,600
If it happens again,

224
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,440
I'll help you.

225
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,720
Thank you, then.

226
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,680
Oh, I'll teach you martial arts.

227
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,840
When you can do martial arts

228
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,840
and meet people like him again,

229
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,410
you can rip them up.

Yueling,

248
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:54,960
you can try the crossbow.

249
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,600
You've nearly hunted all the rabbits.

250
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,600
Shall I try it against the tree?

251
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:58,920
Some more rabbits are there.

252
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,800
I'll ride over there.

253
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,720
Have a good time here alone, Your Highness.

254
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,590
Good.

255
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,690
We'll start with such simple moves.

256
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,290
To do martial arts,
you must plant your feet steadily.

257
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,210
It's really thought of you.

258
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,360
You cared this much for me.

259
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,530
This is what I should do. We're friends.

260
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,490
Don't be afraid of exhaustion.

261
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,400
I'll practice with you.

262
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,080
Thank you, then.

263
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,880
We're almost done, huh?

264
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,120
I think

265
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,290
we've been doing this for four hours.

266
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,640
But why do I feel

267
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,250
we've only been doing this for one hour?

268
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,290
How's that possible?

269
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:20,290
I'm so tired...

270
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,560
No. I mean

271
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,840
we've done enough today.

272
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:25,920
How about

273
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,160
we take a rest for now?

274
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,120
It doesn't matter.

275
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,320
I can practice for a bit longer.

276
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,530
I can't continue.

277
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,160
I really can't.

278
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,730
Are you all right?

279
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,160
Let me get you there for a rest.

280
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,480
Come on.

281
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,010
No, thanks.

282
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,010
Let me help you.

283
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:53,850
No need.

284
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,490
Su Nian, you're awesome.

285
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:07,880
I'm too tired to continue.

286
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,530
But you can keep doing it.

287
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,730
You have no idea.

288
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,450
We practice dancing

289
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,080
just like how you practice martial arts.

290
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,290
We focus on the center
of body weight and strengths.

291
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,560
That's why I can do this.

292
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,290
Now I finally know,

293
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,210
"One will not succeed

294
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,530
before going through all the hardships."

295
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,080
You must have gone through a lot

296
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,360
before you became the most gorgeous lady her.

297
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:54,890
Yueling!

298
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,050
Yueling!

299
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,840
Yueling!

00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,730
I'm here!

00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,720
Yueling.

302
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,130
Yueling.

303
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,000
Yueling,

304
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,970
how did you fall off the horse?

305
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,490
My horse was startled.

306
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:15,360
I had to jump off it.

307
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:16,930
Then I...

308
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:20,570
Don't move.

how did you get hurt?

317
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,450
A branch fell...

318
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,210
Any better?

319
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,010
You twisted your ankle.

320
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:32,210
Let's take a rest somewhere.

321
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,400
When it stops snowing,

322
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,800
we'll ride away.

323
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:35,870
All right.

324
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:37,770
Come on.

325
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,880
- I want...
- I want...

326
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,290
You go first.

327
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,010
We've come this far.

328
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:02,250
Pretending to be my eldest sister,

329
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,320
I came here.

330
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,640
I didn't expect things to be so complicated.

331
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,250
I don't know what to do now.

332
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,160
So, I think we should
take care of the engagement

333
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,050
as soon as we can.

334
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,010
That's exactly what I'm thinking.

335
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:15,770
So, I want...

336
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,010
Is there any way to break off this engagement?

337
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,080
What do you want to do?

338
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,490
I haven't made up my mind.

339
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,320
I just want to go home.

340
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,730
Give me three months.

341
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,360
I'll get you back to Dongyu by then.

342
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:08,890
Really?

343
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:45,960
(I want you)

344
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,840
(to stay by my side.)

345
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,250
Clean carefully.

346
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,450
Clear the way.

347
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,080
Clean over here.

348
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,140
(Auspicious and Fortunate)

349
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,560
Your Highness, you're up.

350
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,800
Come get washed.

351
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:37,700
(The North Prince's Mansion)

352
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:38,770
Greetings, Your Highness.

353
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,010
You twisted your ankle.

354
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,160
Don't force yourself to walk.

355
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:24,900
(The North Prince's Mansion)

356
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,490
Her Grace is back.

357
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:03,770
Let's go have a look.

358
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,970
Yueling, you're back.

359
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,880
Your Grace, you're finally back.

360
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,080
Have some rest.

361
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,840
I'll have an imperial physician
check on your sprain.

362
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,720
Sprain?

363
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,770
- Yueling.
- Your Grace.

364
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,450
- Yueling, what happened?
- Your Grace, what happened?

365
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:06,010
- Nothing.
- You're injured?

366
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,290
Your sister twisted her ankle.

367
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,720
Take good care of her.

368
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:10,810
Twisted her ankle?

369
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,290
How did that happen, Yueling?

370
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,730
Let me check.

371
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:16,600
I'm fine.

372
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:18,810
Your Grace.

373
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,320
Did he hurt you?

374
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,640
There he is.

375
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:29,370
Your Highness.

376
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,730
You're awesome.

377
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,360
You either took no action

378
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,690
or took impressive action.

379
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,400
You made Her Grace happy so quickly.

380
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:38,010
You even stayed together

381
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,050
on such a beautiful night.

382
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,010
Your Highness, you're so resourceful

383
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:41,930
and victorious...

384
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:42,770
Shut up.

385
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:50,710
It hurts.

386
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:51,840
I... I'll be gentle, then.

387
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:54,370
How about this?

388
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:57,530
How shall I put it?

389
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:03,330
I'll just ask.

390
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,920
Yueling,

391
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,930
how could you stay out all night?

392
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,290
I twisted my ankle. Can't you see?

393
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:16,770
And it was snowing.

394
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:19,120
You not only stayed out all night

395
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,880
but also spent the night with the North Prince.

396
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,400
He even carried you back.

397
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:35,880
Yueling, you're pretending
to be our eldest sister.

398
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,490
We're going back to Dongyu someday.

399
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,120
He promised me.

400
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:41,880
In three months,

401
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,530
we can go back to Dongyu.

402
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:45,130
Really?

403
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,120
He lied to you so many times.

404
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,600
Can he still be reliable?

405
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,250
Yueling, verbal statements are no guarantee.

406
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,600
I think you need a written guarantee.

407
00:30:58,290 --> 00:30:59,130
You have a point.

408
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:02,210
- Your Grace.
- Yueling.

409
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:03,000
Where are you going?

410
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,930
Yueling, where are you going?

411
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,730
- Your ankle hasn't recovered.
- I'll go get a guarantee.

412
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,160
Look. Clean over here.

413
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,840
- Your Grace.
- I'm fine.

414
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,720
Come in.

415
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:53,120
Linmu, rub the ink stick for me.

420
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,050
Yueling?

421
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,080
You work really hard.

422
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,320
So many things to handle.

423
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,250
Not really.

424
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,970
Why didn't you let me know you were here?

425
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,050
You didn't even look up.

426
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,800
So, I didn't disturb you.

427
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,880
Call me next time.

428
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,840
Is there some reason

429
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,800
why you're here?

430
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:50,290
Yes, I'm here for something.

431
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,050
But not a very big deal.

432
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,120
Feel free to tell me.

433
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,580
You told me

434
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,930
I could leave in three months.

435
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,120
But you lied to me many times.

436
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:10,880
I'm afraid you may go back on your word.

437
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:16,200
May I ask for a guarantee or something?

438
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:21,000
For example, a decree from your brother

439
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,120
for the delay of the wedding.

440
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:29,730
All right.

441
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:31,210
I'll get that for you.

442
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:42,960
